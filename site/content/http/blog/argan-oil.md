Argan oil is made from kernels of the Argan tree which is native to Morocco. Its scientific nomenclature is [Aragania Spinosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argan_oil). 

This oil has such diverse benefits that it has also been called liquid gold. It is golden in color and has a hazelnut like flavor. 

As the source trees are found only in a limited area and the extraction process is tedious and time-consuming, Argan oil is rare and high-priced. Not to mention it is [carefully extracted by hand](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303768104577460504019108684). Its shelf life is only 3 to 6 months.

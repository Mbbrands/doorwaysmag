Pu Erh Tea comes from the Camelia sinensis plant, the same plant that brings us white, green, and black tea. 

Pu Erh, however, is created using a different process than most teas. It is fermented and then aged under high humidity. The longer the tea has been aged the better it tastes. 

Itâ€™s perfect for stimulating mental alertness as well as reducing high cholesterol. 



## Benefits of Pu Erh Tea

Unlike other teas, Pu Erh tea contains a surprising chemical called lovastatin. This chemical is actually used in prescription medication to lower cholesterol. 

Drinking this tea is practically taking natural medication to lower cholesterol levels which, in the long run, protects your heart from cardiovascular disease. 

Studies on animals have shown that this type of tea may also lower triglycerides and lipoprotein  LDL cholesterol, while raising levels of the good cholesterol, known as lipoprotein HDL cholesterol.  

Another benefit of Pu Erh tea is its stimulating effect on the mind. This is contributed to the caffeine found in the tea itself.  It is important to note, however, that the caffeine found in PU Erh tea is lower than that found in other teas. 



## Nutrients



Pu Erh tea has a rich smooth earthy taste with overtones such as plums or chocolate. When steeped, the color of the tea is often very dark brown. Drinking Pu Erh tea will provide you with catechin, also called tannin, a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent the growth of cancer cells.  

This tea is also high in vitamin C, E, as are flavonoids and minerals. Minerals found in Pu Erh tea include manganese, potassium, and calcium.  

Caffeine is present providing 60 mg of caffeine per 8oz cup from Black Pu Erh and 30-40 mg of caffeine from Green Pu Erh. When taken in moderation, this tea is considered safe. 

Due to the caffeine levels, drinking more than 5 cups a day can lead to the usual side effects of caffeine overdose including: headache, sleep problems, irritability, tremors, heartburn, dizziness, and shaky hands. This can be avoided through moderation. 

It is not harmful to pregnant/breastfeeding women if they limit it to two cups per day.  Children may also have this tea in small amounts. 

Individuals sensitive to caffeine may need to avoid this tea as caffeine can cause irregular heartbeats, diarrhea, and glaucoma, and IBS in individuals sensitive to caffeine. 



## Origin



Pu Erh tea is black tea that has undergone additional fermentation and aging processes.  The aging process lasts a minimum of 3 years, but is preferred to last 5. Pu Erh originated from the Yunnan 
province in China and has been used over the span of 2,000 years. 

It is sold in various pressed shapes as well as in loose leaf form. Today Yunnan province continues to be the main producer of Pu Erh tea. The tea can come in green tea or black tea variety. 

Variety is also determined by the source of cultivation. Plantation bushes that are grown at low altitudes/flat terrain are often considered an inferior source of Pu Erh tea due to the chemical fertilizers/pesticides used. This variety of tea also lacks the deep flavors found in higher quality Pu Erh tea. 

The second variety comes from wild arbor trees. These trees often produce better tasting leaves, and are organically treated. Sometimes these wild arbor trees are actually trees from old plantations that were cultivated generations ago that have gone wild while not in use. 

The most prized Pu Erh tea comes from old wild trees that grew without any human intervention at all. They produce the best flavor which has camphor, minty flavors. 



## Where to Buy



Some stores do sell Pu Erh tea as boxed tea, however it will be hard to find. Online you can find many suppliers of loose leaf Pu Erh tea.  The average quantity for loose leaf Pu Erh is 2 oz. This amount provides between 25-30 teaspoons of tea. This quantity sells for an average price of $8. 

It is also sold in the ancient compressed cake brick style. Sold in this form, the average quantities are by ounce, quarter pound and pound. A pound costs around $70, a quarter pound $19, and an ounce around $6.

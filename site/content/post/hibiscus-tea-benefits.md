Hibiscus tea is created from the deep red flowers of the Hibiscus sabdariffa plant. Its popular for its cranberry like tartness and it's fascinating health benefits. 

This tea has the ability to promote a healthy appetite, cure colds faster as well as improve heart health, and treat upper respiratory tract pain/swelling. Those who suffer from stomach irritation, circulation problems or dissolving phlegm, benefit from this tea.  



## Benefits of Drinking Hibiscus Tea



Studies have shown that hibiscus tea is very effective in treating high blood pressure. In fact, studies have shown that drinking hibiscus tea for a duration of 4 weeks is just as effective as captopril, a prescription drug for those with high blood pressure. The verdict on this benefit is still pending. Some scientists believe that it is only helps maintain the blood pressure levels of those already in a healthy range. 

This tea is loaded with Vitamin C. This vitamin plays a vital role in supporting the immune system, aiding iron absorption, and boosting antioxidant effects. This helps build your body's natural defenses against common colds and lowers your chance of developing a chronic disease.  

It may even be potent against stomach cancer, according to a Taiwanese laboratory study. During this study it was discovered that hibiscus extract was toxic to cancer cells, particularly to human gastric carcinoma cells. This may be due to the high polyphenol levels found within the hibiscus plant. 

Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants that have the ability to reduce the amount of free radicals located in the body. 



## Nutrients



Vivid red to deep red in color, Hibiscus tea can be compared to cranberry juice in terms of tartness. In fact, it is known as "sour tea" in Iran. The flavor can be attributed to the high levels of citric, maltic, and tartaric acid. 

Nutrients such as choline, folate, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin A, vitamin C and carotene can be found in this refreshing tea. The tea also contains minerals such as calcium, copper, Iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc. 

Hibiscus tea is naturally caffeine free and is considered safe when taken in reasonable amounts and there are no known serious side effects. Pregnant women are warned to use it with caution as there have been rumors of hibiscus tea starting menstruation which could lead to a miscarriage during pregnancy. 

There is no concrete evidence for this though. But as always, it is better to err on the side of caution. Hibiscus may also affect blood sugar levels, so one must not use it up to 2 weeks before a surgery as it may make it harder to control your blood sugar. 



## Origin



Originating in Angola, hibiscus has spread its way through both tropical and subtropical regions. Today it can be found in higher quantities in countries such as Egypt, Mexico, China, Sudan, and Thailand, as well as other countries.

It is derived from the sepals of the roselle hibiscus sabdariffa flower. This is the most commonly used variety for hibiscus tea, although an older variety hibiscus rosa-sinensis is also used. 



## Where to Buy



Today, hibiscus tea can be purchased for $4 and up per 1.7 oz (48 grams) in tea bags or around $29 for a pound of organic loose hibiscus. Most mainstream grocery stores carry at least one brand of hibiscus tea, but you will find a much larger variety online for this tea ranging from organic and all natural to boxed, and loose leaf variations.

Many homeowners I've worked with are aware of the importance of a home inspection. After all it’s one of the easiest ways to find out if a home has any hidden secrets or serious maintenance issues. 



However, more than 1 in 10 homeowners (12 percent) confused a  home inspection with an appraisal, according to a survey released by the <em>American Society of Home Inspectors</em> (ASHI).



<strong>The survey also found that more than one in every four homeowners (28 percent) mistakenly believes the purpose of an inspection is to verify that a home complies with local building codes</strong>.



<h2>So, what exactly is a home inspection checklist and why do you need one?</h2>



For the new homeowner a <em>"home inspection"</em> sounds like a thorough review of the entire house. If there are any problems they should be found during an inspection, right? 



Well, the truth is that an inspector will only make <strong>"visual inspections"</strong> of the home. 



<strong>This means an inspector may not be able to detect any problems that are hidden in the walls or under the floors that they cannot see.</strong>



After making inspections of <em>"readily accessible, visually observable, installed systems and components"</em> (via ASHI Standards) the inspector will create a report that may include both descriptions and photos of what they observed. 



If you're <a href="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/guide-to-buying-a-house/" target="_blank">getting ready to buy a home</a> (even if it’s brand new), my checklist will help you prepare questions to ask the home inspector both before and after the inspection.



Most home inspections occur before the sale of a home on behalf of the buyer. However, this isn’t the only time you should inspect your home. 



You may consider using this guide and checklist to complete a DIY inspection every few years to catch any potential problems.



Even if you don’t know the first thing about home construction or inspections, it’s important to be at the house during the inspection. Feel free to tag along with the inspector and ask questions along the way. <strong>Their job is to identify any potential problems for YOU.</strong> 



Also during the inspection you can point out any areas that you were concerned about during your pre-inspection walk-through.



Keep in mind that even if a home inspection comes back clean, there may be hidden problems that will reveal themselves later when you least expect it. 



<em>Inside our checklist we reveal the answers to the most common questions home buyers and sellers have about inspections.</em> 



In fact, some of the secrets we reveal might make the inspection industry fighting mad. So grab these valuable guides now before they make us take them down!

<h2>What’s Included in a Home Inspection Report?</h2>



For homeowners undertaking their first home inspection it is absolutely essential to understand what’s included in the final inspection report as well as what’s not. 



To help make this process easier we’ve outlined what a typical home inspection report will include and what it won’t.



There are many areas of the home that the inspector will not inspect. These areas will need to be inspected by another professional, or you will need to take on the task yourself. 



At a minimum you should visually inspect any areas that you may be concerned about and call in a professional if you need more help.



Our checklist includes a small sample of questions to ask your inspector during or after the inspection. These questions were designed to be a guideline for you to use when looking at the home. Since there are thousands of variations of materials, possible problems and situations, you may need to research additional questions prior to the inspection.



<strong>A standard home inspection report includes: </strong>

<ul>

<li>Structural Components</li>

<li>Exterior Components</li>

<li>Interior Components</li>

<li>Roof &amp; Attic</li>

<li>Plumbing</li>

<li>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)</li>

<li>Electrical</li>

</ul>



These are just a few examples of what an inspector looks for. But, you might be surprised what they don't check for.

What could be more fun than singing in the shower? Singing with the accompaniment of music from a showerhead speaker, that’s what! 

Imagine how much fun it would be waking up under a nice warm stream of water while you listen to your [favorite tunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). Showerhead speakers utilize a form of wireless technology and come in a number of styles to choose from that are affordable and easy to use.

As you may have noticed there are very few styles of showerhead speakers on the market. Although we like all of the models above, there is very little variety when it comes to spray options. 

If you prefer a high pressure or low flow showerhead, you're out of luck. Instead, you may want to consider purchasing your showerhead and speakers separately.

Besides adding music to your bathing routine, showerhead speakers also come with a wide range of features. You do not have to sacrifice comfort and efficiency just to listen to music when there are models that give you just as much water pressure, or even more, than standard showerheads. 

These showerheads are also [energy efficient](http://www.epa.gov/watersense/) which means that they can also help save you money on your water bill.

It is possible to find showerhead speakers to match the décor of almost any bathroom. There are a vast number of attractive styles and finishes to choose from that include nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, plastic, and polished chrome, among many other choices. 

If you have been thinking about adding wireless showerhead speakers to your bath but do not know where to start looking, here are a few of the most popular models with the best reviews that can get you pointed in the right direction.

## Benefits of Peppermint Oil



Many scientific studies have been done on the healing and soothing properties of Peppermint essential oil. Some say it is the most scientifically studied herb on the market.

It has the unique ability to treat indigestion, relieve nausea, and reduce stomach and bowel spasms. The many health benefits of peppermint have been well documented. Its success lies in its carminative property. Because Peppermint is a carminative, it calms the stomach by removing excess gas. 

It also relaxes the muscles of the GI tract, which explains why it is such a common ingredient in many over-the-counter medications. Many individuals suffering from IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, have found relief through the use of peppermint essential oils and capsules. 

In addition to the digestive system, peppermint oil is very beneficial for hair care. It has the ability to remove dandruff and lice while simultaneously refreshing/soothing the head through its cooling sensation. Peppermint is antiseptic as well as stimulating. It relieves a scalp that is irritated and dry helps return the shine to limp dull hair.



## Uses



Peppermint is very universal. It can be used in teas, massaged directly into the skin, inhaled, and ingested in capsule form. It is even used as a food flavoring in some instances. Peppermint also blends well with other essential oils such as eucalyptus, lemon, and rosemary. 

As with any other alternative it needs to be used carefully and diluted. There have been cases of allergic reactions, heartburn, and headaches. It is suggested that one uses small amounts to determine whether or not peppermint has this effect on you. Those who suffer from epilepsy or are currently pregnant are advised against using peppermint essential oil.



## Origin



Peppermint is native to Europe and has been used for hundreds of years. It is considered one of the worldâ€™s oldest medicines.The plant itself is a cross between the water mint and the Spearmint.  The essential oil is extracted from the flowering plant through the process of steam distillation. 

The flowering plant is first placed into a vacuum-sealed container and heated with steam. This opens the oil pockets within the plant and releases it into the vapor. The vapor is then cooled and the oil is then separated from the condensation and ready to use. 

While peppermint is the most common and popular variety used, there are other mint varieties available on the market. These varieties include corn mint and  spearmint. Spearmint has a much smaller amount of menthol then peppermint and is more suitable for children, while corn mint is high in menthol. 

These varieties have different affects and compositions then peppermint and must be used carefully as they may not achieve the same effect as peppermint. 



## Where to Buy



Peppermint essential oil can be purchased from Young Living Essential oils. The typical quantity is 10ml or 15 ml.  A 15 ml bottle from Young Living Essential oils costs $28.29. 

It is important to note, however, that the concentration plays a large role in determining the cost. Young Living Peppermint oil is four times as concentrated as the typical peppermint oil on the market. 

Smaller concentrations can be purchased for around $7.49 per 10 ml bottle from Planet Therapy and Healing Solutions.

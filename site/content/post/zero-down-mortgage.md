## How to Buy a House with No Money Down



These no money down strategies are taken from real world examples. 

Many investors have experienced continued success purchasing real estate with no money down even in a dormant real estate market.



### Better Terms at Higher Price



For various reasons many sellers will be more sensitive to their final sale price and less concerned about up front cash. For example, a seller may be willing to give a buyer attractive terms with no money down at (or above) the full asking price. 

Sometimes a seller is unwilling to accept the purchase terms without a down payment. In this situation many investors have been able to complete the purchase by offering a higher price to cover the down payment. 

This type of deal benefits both the buyer and the seller. When there is minimal cash available to the buyer, profits are typically higher for the seller. 

On the other hand, when a buyer has access to more cash the price can generally be negotiated lower.



### Paper Equity Strategy



One no money down investing strategy that is widely used is substituting a second mortgage for cash equity. 

Purchasing a property using the paper equity strategy requires no down payment from the buyer. In this situation the seller takes her equity in the form of a second or third mortgage. 

The buyer then repays the sellers equity over a period of time as guaranteed by the additional mortgage. During the purchase no cash in transferred between parties.

There are many names for this type of strategy such as **"paper-out"** or **"paper equity formula."**

This situation is unique because it puts the buyer in a position of 100 percent leverage. 

For most investors this is a bad position to be in because it usually results in negative cash flows. Savvy real estate investors can use the income from other properties to pay for the deficit until it can be corrected or sold. 



### Balloon Down Payment



When a seller is motivated to make a deal quickly, they may not be interested in recovering all of their equity immediately. In this case the seller may be willing to receive a series of balloon down payments overtime. 

After purchasing the property using this strategy, the buyer can use the income generated from the property to make balloon payments. These are typically made 3 to 6 months after the sale of the property. In some cases balloon payments can be made several years later. 

The delayed payment gives the buyer enough time to come up with the money or sell the property for a quick profit. Zero money down real estate investing often requires quick moves and creative thinking.



### Down Payments Paid Monthly



The reason so many aspiring homeowners are interested in buying a home with no down payment is because they have limited cash available. 

When purchasing an income producing property buyers can use their new monthly income to finance the down payment over time. 

By assuming the sellers existing loan and making a large monthly payment with interest on the sellers equity, a purchase can be made with no down payment.

Usually a motivated seller will be willing to take a full price offer with no down payment, rather than a reduced price all cash deal. 

This strategy also gives the buyer flexibility to sell the property for a quick profit within the first 30 days to avoid paying interest on the financed down payment. 



### "Subject to" Financing



Purchasing a home with "subject to" financing means that the original terms of the note will stay the same including the name the loan was made to. 

**More simply put: the purchase is subject to the existing mortgage.**

In this no money down strategy the buyer does not assume the loan. The new terms are made only between the buyer and the seller. 

The deed is signed over to the buyer while the loan remains in the sellers name. The mortgage is paid by the buyer on behalf of the seller from that point on. 

This is an attractive investing option for both parties. When a seller must act quickly, this eliminates the time it takes to put a house on the market and close on a new loan. 

It also makes the sale available to buyers who are unable to acquire traditional financing. In this situation the benefits are the speed and reduced paper work that subject to financing offers.

These strategies are just the tip of the iceberg for buying a house with zero money down. Of course there are many others that have helped successful investors buy property with no down payment. 

When purchasing property with no money down, creativity is the name of the game.

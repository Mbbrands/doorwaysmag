American Woodmark Cabinets is dedicated to helping its customers recreate their homes to both functional and stylish. The company offers many convenient, desirable features such as wine racks, recycling centers, and storage. 

With American Woodmark Cabinets, your things can have a designated spot helping you maintain an organized home. 

For the past 35 years, American Woodmark has partnered exclusively with [The Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Cabinets-Cabinet-Hardware/American-Woodmark/N-5yc1vZas87Zc15). Simply find a Home Depot store nearest to you to view the cabinets in person.

## Company Background

The company has its [headquarters in Virginia](http://woodmarkcabinetry.com/) and 14 manufacturing plants throughout several states. 

The company is certified by the [Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association](http://www.kcma.org/) and has been in operation since 1980.

## Construction Quality

American Woodmark starts with a front face frame. This frame is crafted from a 3/4" x 1-5/8" solid hardwood. This wood is then dried in a kiln to prevent the possibility of it warping. 

The joints of the face frame are then pressure fitted and glued to increase the adhesion. Afterwards, the frame is double dowelled, and stapled for durability and stability.

From here, customers can choose whether or not they want a standard construction cabinet or one made completely with plywood. 

The standard construction uses 1/2" thick side panels made of engineered wood. Full plywood construction only uses 1/2‚Äù thick furniture grade plywood with a _Beauty Guard Finish_. 

The drawers feature a premium hardwood dovetail construction with a plywood bottom panel. 

**American Woodmark offers several types of doors including:**

* Full Overlay
* Partial Overlay
* Solid Wood
* Veneer
* Raised Center Panel
* Flat Center Panel
* Thermo Foil

When it comes to hardware, American Woodmark offers self-closing drawers with steel ball bearings. Other unique features include self-cleaning tracks and a four-sided designed that balances weight and pressure evenly. 

Customers also have the option to upgrade to CushionClose for quiet performance and to eliminate slamming. 

The company takes the time to finish the face frames and doors with their Beauty Guard 

Finishing System. This requires a multistep process of sanding, brushing, cleaning, and catalyzing a topcoat that will protect your cabinet from water damage and ensure easy cleaning.

## Common Complaints

Compared to other companies, American Woodmark had surprisingly few negative reviews online. The majority of the complaints were directed at Home Depot's installation problems and damaged items on delivery. 

The hassle of returns is a possibility so make sure to plan for delays. That way you are not pressured into installing a defective piece.

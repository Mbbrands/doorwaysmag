But, your cabinets are just half the battle in the kitchen design process.

Below you’ll find out the best paint colors for kitchens with white cabinets and other great kitchen color schemes.

One advantage of choosing kitchen paint colors with white cabinets is that your options are wide open. Unfortunately, the amount of choices can become overwhelming for most homeowners. 

The key is to choose a color that will go well with your cabinets, countertops, backsplash and flooring, all while matching your existing decor. **Don’t worry it’s easier than it sounds.**

Here are my recommendations of wall colors that go great with white cabinets.

It should be no surprise that the most popular colors that go with white cabinets are whites, tans and grays. These neutral colors will keep your kitchen looking fresh, clean and sophisticated for years to come.

There are many variations of these colors that will go great with almost all white cabinets. But, for your reference I've included the wall colors shown in these photos in case you want to make this easy on yourself.

This traditional kitchen features white cabinets with white subway tile and dark granite countertops. If you’ve looked at other kitchen paint colors you’ll notice that white is a popular wall color. I realize that some of you may be looking for warmer palettes.

This kitchen does a great job balancing the white backsplash and cabinets with warm hues on the walls. The paint color on the walls in this kitchen is Sherwin Williams Pavestone (SW7642).



## Benjamin Moore Danville Tan

We all know that the kitchen is the central hub for most families today. Why not add some energy to the space with a lighter color on the walls? With white marble countertops, this tan wall color helps brighten up the space, while giving it a warm feel.

The difference between these two photos may seem subtle, but there are a few design lessons to be learned. 

For one, your kitchen countertops play a big role in your kitchen color schemes. Dark wall colors blend well with dark countertops and light wall colors compliment light countertop materials very well.

This kitchen features Benjamin Moore Danville Tan paint on the walls.

For those of you that are more adventurous, here is a great example of how a bright wall color can completely transform your space. The great thing about painting your kitchen walls is that the color can be changed whenever you feel like it!

Although some may say that painting your kitchen is a time consuming and tedious process, it’s important to point out that paint is only temporary. Feel free to take a risk and go with an energetic color that matches your personality. Have some fun!

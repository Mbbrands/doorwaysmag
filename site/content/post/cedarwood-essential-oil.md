Unlike other essential oils, Cedarwood essential oil is not made from flowers and leaves. Instead, it is made from wood and root of different coniferous trees. The scientific nomenclature of these trees is [Juniperus Virgiana](http://www.fao.org/docrep/v5350e/v5350e12.htm). Cedarwood oil is used in diverse fields like art, aromatherapy, perfume industry, industrial factories and medicine.

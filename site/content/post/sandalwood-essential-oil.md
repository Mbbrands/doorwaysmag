Featuring a warm, woody, rich scent, Sandalwood oil is well know for its use in fragrant products. It has been a vital part of religious and spiritual traditions since before written history.  

Sandalwood is also popular for its medicinal properties. 

This essential oil is in high demand and its supply is limited, as it is extracted from the bark of mature sandalwood trees.

## Benefits



Sandalwood offers a multitude of benefits. It is known to be a powerful anti-septic, antispasmodic, astringent, carminative, and fragrant substance. Its antiseptic properties are valued because it is safe for both internal and external applications. 

When taken internally, sandalwood essential oil protects internal wounds and ulcers from infections. When applied topically, it also protects wounds, sores, and even pimples from developing infections and prevents the possibility of the wound becoming septic. 

It is also used quite frequently as an anti-inflammatory treatment. In both paste and oil forms, sandalwood provides a cooling effect and is said to relieve inflammation in the brain, as well as in the digestive system, nervous, circulatory, and excretory systems. 



## Uses



Sandalwood essential oil is used in medicines, skin/beauty treatments and even in industrial products. It is often the favored essential oil in products such as mouth fresheners, incense sticks, deodorants, and room fresheners. 

There are no known risks associated with sandalwood, however, it is recommended to dilute sandalwood with a carrier oil before using it as a topical treatment. 



## Origin



Sandalwood oil originates from the Sandalwood tree, also known as the Santalum Album, a member of the Santalacea family. This tree is a parasite by nature and requires a host plant in order to survive. 

It grows in dry rocky environments and is found naturally occurring in Eastern India. Particularly in the states of Mysore, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnitka. It has also been successfully cultivated in other Southeast Asian locations such as Indonesia. 

The oil is extracted from the wood, sap, and roots of the tree through the process of steam distillation. Sandalwood has to be extracted from a mature tree, generally between 40-80 years old. The older the tree, the more oil it will yield. 

Steam is passed over the powdered wood and thereby releases the oil locked within the cellular structure of the wood. After being cooled, the resulting water and oil are separated. Another method used to extract sandalwood is known as hydro-distillation. 

Though not used as often, this method produces oil with a more powerful aroma. Instead of steam passing over the bark, the powdered wood is soaked in water and heated from below. The steam from this process is then cooled and the oil separated from the water. 

Sandalwood comes in several varieties. These varieties greatly vary in their use and aroma. Indian Sandalwood, Santalum album, is the most popular though growing rarer by the day. The Hawaiian Sandalwood, Santalum Ellipticum, is also quite rare and expensive. 

Australian Sandalwood (Sandalwood Spicatum), is often used commercially as it is cheaper than the expensive Indian and Hawaiian varieties. 



## Where to Buy



Sandalwood is often sold in 5 ml bottles, but can be found in quantities of 10 ml, 15 ml and higher. The price of the essential oil greatly varies depending on the quantity, the grade of the oil, and the type of Sandalwood tree the oil was extracted from. 

The average price for a 5ml bottle of Indian Sandalwood (Sandalwood album) is between $40-70.  The company Edenâ€™s Gardens offers it for $39.75 per 5ml plus an additional $7.99 for shipping. Hawaiian Sandalwood ranges in price from $70-$170 per 5ml of essential oil. 

Australian Sandalwood sells for a price similar to Indian Sandalwood. It can be bought from the Om Shoppe for a price of $59 per 5ml. A cheaper alternative is offered by Simpler Botanicals for a cost of $29 for 5ml of essential oil. The oil from this company is harvested from sustainably grown Sandalwood trees.

Filled with powerful antioxidants and nutrients, this drink is popular for its medicinal properties related weight loss, cancer prevention, as well as improving concentration and mental alertness. 



## Why Drink Green Tea?



**Swelling, Inflammation and Bone Health**

Green tea has a long list of potential health benefits. The molecule polyphenols, found in this tea is known to prevent swelling and inflammation. It is also thought to  protect cartilage between bones as well as decrease joint degeneration/osteoporosis. 

Studies have indicated that drinking green tea over the span of 10 years is linked with increased bone mineral density. In fact, some studies show that drinking 500 mg of green tea containing catechin, a powerful antioxidant, everyday for 24 weeks alone helps improve the bone strength of post-menopausal women suffering from low bone density. 

**Weight Loss and Mental Alertness**

Weight loss is always a popular health benefit. Green tea increases your energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Drinking it for 3 months has been show to decrease the waist circumference by 4.5%. 

It is also beneficial for mental alertness due to its caffeine content. I have often found it pleasant to curl up with a book, or study with a cup of hot green tea as it helped me stay alert for longer periods of time. It always gives me the perfect dose of caffeine and energy without the jittery effect I get from regular coffee. 

**Infections, Cholesterol, and Cancer Prevention**

Green tea appears to fight HPV infections as well as minimize the growth of abnormal sells in the cervix, a condition known as cervical dyslplasia.  There is actually an FDA approved ointment for warts that uses green tea as its primary ingredient. 

Those with high cholesterol levels may also benefit from green tea as it lowers cholesterol levels. Several studies have shown that drinking 145-3000 mg of green tea deal for 24 weeks significantly lowers cholesterol levels as well as lipoprotein, which is considered bad cholesterol for the body. 

Additional long term benefits include a lower risk of developing ovarian cancer as well as avoiding Parkinson’s disease when one drinks one to four cups of green tea every day.
	


## Nutrients



When I first started drinking green tea I was surprised to learn that it comes from the same plant as black tea and white tea. The color and health benefits are determined by the fermentation of the leaves. Black tea is the most fermented type, while green tea and white tea are less fermented. 

As you have probably guessed from the name, Green tea is a light green/yellow color. It has a slightly bitter and grassy taste, although the taste depends greatly on the quality of the leaves and the steeping method used. Other common descriptions used for green tea include bittersweet, nutty, and vegetal.

It contains polyphenols such as flavonoids and catechins that are powerful antioxidants. These antioxidants work to reduce free radicals an the body. 

This helps protect your cells from damage as well as minimize the risk of many diseases and even some types of cancer. One of the most prominent antioxidants found in green tea is known as Epigallocatchin Gallate, EGCG for short. 

This amino-acid also increases your levels of dopamine and alpha waves giving you a sensation of contentment.  Combined with the caffeine, this combination gives you a more stable source of energy, than drinking caffeine alone.

Green tea does contain around 2% to 4% caffeine with helps promote the mental alertness. This is less than you will find in a typical cup of coffee.  While it is generally considered safe for adults, one must exercise some moderation. Some people do have an upset stomach reaction when they drink it in access. 

Preferably, you should not drink more than five cups per day. The caffeine levels found in green tea can cause headaches, sleep problems, will minimize your bodies ability to absorb iron from food, and other dangerous side effects linked to caffeine overdose. 

Be sure to keep the caffeine dosage in mind when giving this tea to children, and only give them small amounts. Likewise, pregnant or breastfeeding women need to limit green tea to two cups per day as this alone will provide 200 mg of caffeine. Drinking more than this can be dangerous and can pass to the infant through breast milk/bloodstream. 

Green tea is so much better for you than coffee due to the amino acid L-Theanine that it contains. This amino acids helps increase the activity of your neurotransmitter GABA, which has the ability to create anti-anxiety effects.

Green tea is derived from the leaf bud, stem, and leaves of the Camellia sanensis plant and is created by steaming the fresh leaves at high temperatures. This process helps save the polyphenol molecules, which seems to be the source of the tea’s health benefits. 

There are many different varieties on the market and the differences are due to the various locations where the tea is grown, the cultivation method, climate differences, and so forth.  

**Popular variations include:**




  * Matcha

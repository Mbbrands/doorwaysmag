![how to sharpen knives](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/how_to_sharpen_knives.jpg)

A knife sharpener is a type of tool that grinds down the blade of a knife in an even manner in order to create a sharp edge. 

Although there are various tools available for sharpening knives like special stones and leather razor strops, electric knife sharpeners are becoming increasingly popular. One reason is due to how easy it is to learn to use. 

One of the most important skills that any good cook should possess is the ability to sharpen their knives. 

Keeping knives sharp is important because a sharp knife works wonders when it comes to slicing and cutting food. But beyond that, using a sharp knife also allows you to work at a faster and safer pace over using even a semi-dull one.

There are a wide variety of knife sharpeners available. When choosing one of these devices, you should look for one that produces a keen edge. 

If you are a novice at sharpening knives, you may want to consider purchasing a sharpener that includes an accurate angle guide. This type of sharpener allows you to insert and hold the knife at the correct angle in order to get a precisely sharpened edge. 

This feature is usually available on many electric models which oftentimes include additional sharpening areas for touching up and polishing the knife blade.

If you also plan on sharpening blades with serrated edges, look for a knife sharpener that includes this feature because not all knife sharpeners have the ability to sharpen every type of blade. 

If you are a southpaw, you will be happy to know that there are styles available that easy to use for both right-handed and left-handed folks. 

**Here are the best knife sharpeners that received positive reviews from chefs in our test kitchen:**

If you are tired of spending an exorbitant amount of time showering due to having a low-pressure water flow, ditch that wimpy showerhead for one that gives you the water pressure you need and deserve. High pressure showerheads give you the pressure you need to get clean while still [conserving water](http://www.epa.gov/greenhomes/ConserveWater.htm) and saving you money.

One of the biggest complaints that people have when using some brands of energy-efficient showerhead models is the uneven water flow they receive due to low pressure. It is important to realize that not all high pressure showerheads on the market are the same. 

Some products do provide a great high pressure flow of water; however, often the tradeoff comes in a high water consumption rate.  Thankfully, there are a large variety of attractive models on the market that can provide the high pressure water flow you need and still operate efficiently.

[**Editor's Note:** If you want maximum pressure, you'll want to look at shower heads that offer 2.5 GPM (Gallons per Minute). That's the highest legal amount of water flow available in the United States under the [Energy Policy Act of 1992](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_1992). ]

High pressure showerheads come in both traditional wall-mounted styles as well as handheld varieties. These showerheads come in a wide array of finish choices such as stainless steel, chrome, and plastic. There are also multiple choices in showerhead designs and water spray pattern options. Changing out a showerhead is a simple process that often requires only the use of your hands and a minimal amount of time.

In order to get a competitive edge on the market, many manufacturers of high pressure showerheads are including high tech sprayer options and other fancy accompaniments such as LED lights that change the color appearance of the water flow. Even with these snazzy features the majority of the high pressure showerheads are still extremely affordable. 

High pressure showerheads are usually constructed from materials that are highly durable and easy to maintain. A large majority of high pressure showerheads additionally include water conservation features that are made to meet or exceed [water usage ordinances](http://www.water.ca.gov/wateruseefficiency/).

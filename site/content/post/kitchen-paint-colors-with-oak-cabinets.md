This traditional kitchen is a great example of how to use color to compliment your Oak cabinets. As you can see the dark granite countertops bring all of the colors together, yet gives you the opportunity to use a wide range of colors.

_Glidden Whispering Wheat_ is a great choice for kitchens with traditional Oak cabinets and dark granite countertops. If you have a light colored tile or linoleum floor, this color is a great match.

Another great kitchen wall color is _Benjamin Moore Hancock Green_. This kitchen features a bolder Oak stain and dark granite kitchen countertops. The green hue on the walls helps bring all elements of the room together.

This kitchen is a great example of how important the [backsplash is in your kitchen design](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/10-classic-kitchen-backsplash-ideas/). The backsplash helps pull in the green and browns and tie the room together. You may also notice that this kitchen has wood flooring as well.

In this kitchen you’ll notice the color palette is considerably different from the previous examples. First, the Oak cabinets have a light stain and the countertops are white granite. In addition, this room has wood flooring which is a lighter stain than the cabinets.

This style of Oak cabinetry lends itself to contrasting, rather than complementary colors. The walls feature a color similar to _Sherwin Williams Darkroom_. 

I should also point out how well the backsplash and wall colors balance out the color palette. 

## Conclusion

As you can see there are many ways to paint your kitchen with Oak cabinets. The examples included a range of cabinet styles as well as countertop, backsplash and flooring variations.

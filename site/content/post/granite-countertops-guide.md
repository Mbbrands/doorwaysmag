## Maintenance



One of the biggest benefits of granite is that it is extremely easy to clean and maintain. Not only is is heat resistant but it will also hold up against stains and bacteria. However, with all that said, granite countertops must be sealed. 

If you purchase countertops from a retail store like Home Depot or Lowe's they usually come pre-sealed. Be sure to ask about sealing when shopping for granite countertops.



## Cost of Granite Countertops



Both granite and marble countertops are unique in that their price is difficult to predict. This is due to the fact that these natural stones have limited local supply. You'll have to choose your slab of granite from a small selection available at a local distributor or fabricator.

Unfortunately, the most popular colors and patterns are likely to go fast. Don't forget, you're competing against local builders, architects and kitchen designers for the perfect piece of granite. 

Looking for a straightforward estimate on how much granite costs? Well, many homeowners on forums will tell you they had their granite installed for around $45 per square foot. Keep in mind this an average price for discount granite - not necessarily premium quality stock. 

When putting together your budget you should expect to pay $75 per square foot or above to have granite countertops installed in your kitchen. Don't forget to include additional costs for edging, sink cutouts and sealing.

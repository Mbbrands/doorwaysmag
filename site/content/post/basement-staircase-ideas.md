Basement staircases don't need to be dark, creepy and narrow like most people think. Instead, there are dozens of ways to freshen up your basement stairs without spending a fortune.

Some of the most elegant ideas we cover below include adding a coat of paint or wood stain to brighten up the stairs. You can also upgrade the railing and newel post to give the stairs a finished look.

While some of the ideas below are jaw-dropping and extravagant, most of the others can be easily built on a small budget. Use the following photos below to spark your next [big basement renovation idea](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/basement-finishing-cost/). **Let's get started...**


Some of the simplest things in life are also the most beautiful. This can be said for staircases as well. The basement stairs in this log home have a natural stain and simple hand railings. What makes this basement special is that the designers were able to incorporate a wet bar and wine storage in a small space.

In this basement the contrast of the wood stairs against the white wainscotting gives it a sophisticated appearance. A medium stain will give any style wood a timeless appearance and the dark color will help hide wear and tear. The designer has also chosen to add a decorative balustrade which compliments the surrounding decor.

If you love traditional farmhouse style homes, you'll love these basement stairs. The treads have a natural stain and contrast nicely with the white risers and balustrade. I should also point out that the handrail is also stained which helps tie in the stairs with the basement hardwood flooring.

Today more people are seeing the benefits of working from home. Whether it's a full-time job or a new side business - everyone needs a place to get some paperwork done besides on the kitchen counter. Why not make the most of the space under your basement stairs to build a small desk and file cabinet. Who knows, this could be the spot where you finally get your million dollar idea.

One way to dress up your basement stairs is by adding a small foyer near the landing. This is especially helpful if you have small or awkward spaces near your stairs. Add a chair and side table to create a comfortable place to sit, instead of collecting dust.

The first thing that jumps out at me when I look at these stairs is of course the abundance of storage. But what you may have missed is the suspended wire and steel handrails. These architectural details can help tie your basement decor in with the rest of the house inexpensively. If you use your basement mainly for storage, these custom drawers are sure to give you a few ideas on how to get organized this year.

Not everyone is a fan of traditional style homes and architecture. If this sounds like you, then this glass staircase is sure to get you excited. Not only are the stairs made of glass, but the entire staircase looks like it's floating. Unlike other stairs in this collection, the designer chose to include a handrail. If you were going for a modern facelift in your home you might choose to remove the handrail completely.

In contrast to the contemporary stairs above, you may not need to replace your stair treads at all to get a new look. Instead, all you need is a gallon of paint and a few stencils to make your basement staircase unique.

So far I've shown you many examples of basements that make the most of the space under the stairs by building out cabinets and desks. Instead, you could leave the stairs open to give your more active space. This farmhouse is able to use this space as a small basement gym without sacrificing valuable floor space.

It's no secret that kids love playing in the basement. Not only can they escape from Mom and Dad but it can be a great place to let their imagination go wild. Why not make the stairs match this playful environment? This designer chose to surround the staircase with plywood, but they left small holes where you can spy through to the other side.

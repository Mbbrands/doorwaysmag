For green tea aficionados, Matcha Green tea offers a unique alternative. The name itself means “powdered tea”.  

This powdered green tea is popular because it is much more potent than regular green tea, and because it offers a higher does of caffeine while providing a calm and alert mind.



## Benefits of Match Green Tea



The benefits of matcha green tea are the same as those found in regular green tea. These benefits, however, are much more potent in matcha tea. 

Consider this, when steeping green tea you discard the leaves, while with matcha you are actually drink them. 

The powder is so fine that it is easily mixed with near boiling water, providing a potent blend of nutrients, and antioxidants. 

The antioxidants found in this tea help free radicals within the body, helping protect you from certain types of cancer, dyslplasia, and Parkinson’s disease. The tea also has a powerful effect on cholesterol.

Drinking matcha green tea daily  has been show to lower cholesterol levels over the course of 24 weeks. Bone density has also been shown to increase when you drink 500 mg of matcha green tea over the same duration. 

It can also be used as a weight loss supplement and mental alertness stimulant. Matcha green tea increases your energy expenditure and increases your fat oxidation rate. Drinking matcha green tea, or even regular green tea can decrease your waist circumference by 4.5% over the course of 3 months. 

The caffeine content is 3 times higher in matcha green tea than regular tea and provides a gradual/stable source of energy unlike the high peak and rapid drop observed with the consumption of coffee. 



## Nutrients



Matcha green tea contains all of the nutrients seen in green tea but in higher proportions. It contains antioxidants including polyphenols and catechins. Drinking this tea also provides you with vitamins such as Vitamin A, B-complex, C, E, and K. 

The powder is mixed with almost boiling water and then whisked to create a frothy dark green tea with a very vegetal, grassy taste. 

Though the caffeine content of matcha green tea is less than that found it coffee, pregnant and nursing women may need to limit their consumption of this drink. Likewise, it is not recommended for children.

Another health warning is the lead content of the tea. While the tea leaves are growing, they naturally absorb lead from the soil and environment. When you drink regular green tea, you steep the leaves and remove them, and 90% of the lead remains in the leaves which are then thrown out. In matcha, the leaves are ground and you consume them leading to a higher consumption of lead. 

Some studies have shown that a cup of match can contain 30 times more lead than a cup cup of green tea.  As such, limit matcha tea to one cup a day and do not serve it to children.



## Origin



The green tea leaves from which matcha is made originally originated in China. Today its leaves are harvested all throughout Asia. It comes from the Camellia saneness plant. Unlike green tea however, the leaves cultivated for matcha are covered with  shade clothes prior to harvest. This helps grow leaves of better texture and taste. 

They are then hand selected, steamed, dried, and aged. Then the leaves are ground into a fine powder for your enjoyment. There are a couple varieties on them market but these differences are based on location and cultivation method rather than the plant itself. 



## Where to Buy



The phrase you get what you pay for certainly applies to matcha green tea. The better the quality the higher the price. Ten ounces of organic Matcha will cost around $25 while cheaper brands average around $10 per 8 oz. 

Most grocery stores carry this type of green tea either in store or on their online. For high quality matcha tea, you will find a wider selection of companies and prices online.

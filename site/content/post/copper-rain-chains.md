Tired of looking at your ugly downspouts? The good news is that I've rounded up 10 rain chains you'll love looking at every time it rains.

**Why are they so popular, anyway?** 

Rain chains are decorative replacements for your ugly downspouts. Every time it rains you'll have a natural water feature hanging from your eaves. 

Install them on your front patio, back porch or outside your kitchen window. 

The best part is that they look great whether it's raining or not. You can order an entire matching set or mix and match to your heart's desire.

**What do they do?**

Instead of the rain from your gutters being sent down a standard aluminum downspout, it runs beautifully down the rain chain. Along the way it bounces and splashes against the chain or gets funneled through small copper cups. 

**Want to install your own DIY rain chains? Here's what you'll need to get started:**

_Note: If you are replacing downspouts that drain near the foundation of your house, you'll need a way to redirect the water down and away from this area. Standing water around your home can cause damage to the foundation or lead to other nasty problems (think rot and mildew)._

I should also mention that most rain chains made of copper. Copper is unique because it develops a greenish blue patina as it is exposed to the elements. This is due to the metal reacting the the [oxidation process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) - it's completely natural. 

If you decide to order rain chains for your home they will look bright and shiny when you first install them. But don't get too attached to the shiny chain because their appearance will change over time.

**Now that we've covered our bases, I present 10 copper rain chains you'll love...**

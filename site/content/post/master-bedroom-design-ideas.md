As I get older, my master bedroom decor and especially my mattress have become more important to me. When I was younger - living wild and free - I could sleep on practically anything and get a full nights rest.

Unfortunately, times have changed. 

Today, I like to surround myself with high quality bedding, inspiring art and bedroom colors that help improve my sleep. 

Since we spend about a third of our life sleeping, I figure your bedroom should be a place you enjoy spending time in. 

If you're like me, then I have good news. I've rounded up a few of my favorite master bedroom ideas to help inspire you.

Beyond your bed, there are a few other items you'll want to shop for to complete your decor. These include headboards, dressers, side tables, seating, lighting, mirrors, window coverings, rugs and art.

If you have a few of these pieces in your bedroom that you want to keep, these should guide your decorating decisions. For example, the color of your bedding or the wood stain on your dresser will be important when selecting complementary colors for your master bedroom.

While the designers in this slideshow make color selection look effortless, it is a skill that you'll need to practice. If you don't get it right the first time you can always swap out decor later. 

**So, without further ado, here are 11 inspiring master bedroom designs...**



The first thing that you should notice about this bedroom is that it features hardwood flooring. The designer used the dark flooring to select complementary colors that unify the entire room. For example, the side table has a similar wood stain as the flooring. In contrast, the dresser is painted white to keep the room from becoming overwhelmed with dark wood.

This contemporary master bedroom is all about textures. You'll notice there are a variety of materials used to give this white room some depth. You can do the same in your bedroom by creating a wood feature wall, installing hardwood flooring, adding a textured rug and using ruffled pillows on the bed.

Unlike other master bedroom ideas we've seen so far, this room uses the bed as the centerpiece for the rest of the design. The tufted bed adds color and texture to the room while everything else tends to blend into the background. For example, the paintings on the wall are plain white and the carpeting has a simple pattern. I should also mention that the color on the wall is Clay Beige OC-11 by Benjamin Moore.

If you prefer a more tranquil bedroom sanctuary, you'll want to steal a few decorating ideas from this photo. The color on the wall is Benjamin Moore Silver Gray 2131-60 which is both soothing and timeless. Throughout the room there are white accents and pale bedding that don't distract from the wall color.

In contrast to a few of the other master bedrooms in this gallery, this room features a few different styles of wood throughout. While this makes decorating a challenge, this designer was able to pull it off by incorporating darker colors. These include Brandon Beige 977 by Benjamin Moore on the walls and a velvet bench at the end of the bed.

Do you have a favorite color that you want to look at every morning when you wake up? This room is a great example to follow. The designer uses yellow as an accent color on the nightstand, bed pillows and bedside seating. Please note that you should use restraint when decorating with a bright color. Don't go overboard or the color could overtake the entire room - something we want to avoid.

On the walls of this bedroom is Benjamin Moore Rockport Gray. This color is a great compliment to the white bedding, hardwood flooring, and charcoal bed frame. If you want to give your bedroom a finished look, don't forget the accessories.

It can be difficult to decorate a  white bedroom. If done right it can look elegant and timeless. On the other hand many white bedrooms just look boring and empty. However, if you want some help on how to do it right, just look at this photo. The designer uses Linen White 912 by Benjamin Moore on the walls to give the room some warmth. Next they've added many accessories including full length window dressing and contrasting side tables.

I've included this photo to show you that you don't always have to cover up hardwood floors with a rug. In this master bedroom the designer has chosen to leave the flooring untouched. While your toes might appreciate a warm rug when you wake up in the morning, it's not a design necessity.

Mirrored dressers have become popular in luxury homes, but there's no reason why you can't include them in more traditional interiors. To pull it off successfully, you'll want to carefully decorate with silver or gray accessories and compliment it with white bedding. Be careful when using bright colors near mirrored furniture as it will pick up the colors around it.

As you can see, there are many ways to decorate your master bedroom. I hope these ideas helped you realize that you don't need to spend a fortune on an expensive designer or high-end furniture to redesign your bedroom.

Instead, pick a focal point in your room and decorate around that item. Whether it be your hardwood flooring, the bed or your favorite color. As we learned from the photos above, there's more than one way to design a beautiful space.

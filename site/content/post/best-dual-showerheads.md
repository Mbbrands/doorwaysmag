When it comes to getting the most out of your shower time, two heads are almost always better than one. 

**This is one reason why more and more people are getting rid of their outdated standard showerhead and replacing it with a high quality dual showerhead model.**

Ideal for either large or small spaces, a dual showerhead gives you the power to direct the water where you need it so you can experience a more thorough feeling of cleanliness in a fraction of the time compared to a [standard showerhead](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/showerheads.htm). 

Whether you choose a model that has two independent stationary spray nozzles, or a version that includes both a separate stationary and handheld spray nozzle, you are sure to be pleased at how much nicer showering can be.

Dual showerheads come in many different finishes that are both durable and attractive. Possible finishes include brass, oil-rubbed bronze, stainless steel, and chrome, among other choices. 

Don't worry, installation is easy. The majority of dual showerheads install quickly and typically require only the use of your hands as a tool. 

Many dual showerheads give you the option of allowing you to use either one or both spray nozzles at the same time which makes it convenient when bathing small children or pets. 

Many of my clients typically find that they are able to enjoy great water pressure even while using both nozzles and still [conserve water](http://wateruseitwisely.com/100-ways-to-conserve/) at the same time.

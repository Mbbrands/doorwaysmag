## Build Quality and Functionality



Featuring stainless steel construction, the unit feels solid during installation and use. The impressive Bio-Charge technology uses a cartridge which injects [microorganisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism) into the waste, facilitating easy breakdown and rendering it completely safe for homes with septic systems. 

The multiple grind chambers combine with the Â¾ HP motor to pulverize all kinds of household waste imaginable. The built-in ring and lug system makes it easy for the unit to chop down tough and stubborn pieces of waste, guaranteeing jam-free, smooth operation. 

The liquefied and treated food waste can also be processed at waste water treatment plants to produce renewable energy, making this product an environment-friendly purchase for your home.



## Noise Reduction & Warranty



The InSinkErator Evolution Septic Assist Garbage Disposal features many different techniques of noise reduction. 

The anti-vibration mount eliminates rattle during operation and insulated grind chamber ensures virtually noise free operation. The inclusion of sink baffle also contributes, preventing noise from escaping at the throat region of the disposal unit.

If you love rustic decor and log homes as much as I do, you'll love these rooms with antler chandeliers. Whether you live in a cabin in the woods or a modern home in Hollywood, a chandelier made from deer antlers can transform any room into a rustic oasis.

Did you know deer shed their antlers and grow new ones every year? If you live near the woods or have deer in your backyard you'll notice that they lose their antlers between [January and April](http://www.grandviewoutdoors.com/big-game-hunting/why-do-deer-shed-their-antlers/). Then, they rapidly grow new ones over the summer.

Since the deer no longer have a use for their former headgear, why not make them into a chandelier?

Even though this shedding process is natural, many eco-friendly homeowners prefer faux antler chandeliers in their homes. If this is important to you, the good news is that there are many of these available online.

Even if you don't live in a log home, a rustic chandelier can be a great complement to hardwood flooring and simple wooden dining room furniture. Especially when you have high ceiling, like in this picture, it is important to use a chandelier to anchor the dining room table.

No one says you have to leave antlers their natural color. Just take a look at this beach side living room featuring a white antler chandelier. Just imagine the possibilities!

One thing that is great about this style chandelier is that it works well in both formal and informal rooms like a bedroom. This design feature works great with vaulted ceilings and helps prevent the room from feeling cavernous.

I can practically picture myself settling in with a cup of hot cider in this ranch style home. Notice that the antlers are stained a mahogany color that perfectly matches the wood throughout the space.

Unlike other rooms in this gallery, this bonus room does not have vaulted ceilings. The designer chose to install a smaller chandelier that is in proportion to the rest of the space. This is an important point to consider when shopping for a light fixtures in your living room.

This log home features a rustic dining room that has enough seating for 10 and a great view of the open concept kitchen. Of course the chandelier is a major focal point and acts as an anchor for the table.

The brick pattern in this kitchen could become overwhelming if left uncontested. Instead, the interior designer was able to balance the straight lines of the bricks with a natural and whimsy antler chandelier. Two of the most important elements in design are balance and contrast, which are perfectly illustrated in this photo.

## Where Can You Buy Antler Chandeliers Online?



You can find a wide range of antler decorations online. A few of our favorite sites include Amazon, Pottery Barn, Wayfair and Little Big Horns.

When shopping for an antler chandelier pay attention to whether the antlers are real or reproduction.  They will both look the same, but there will be significant weight and quality differences between the two.

If you are looking for a unique centerpiece to hang above your dining room table you could even consider having a chandelier custom made.

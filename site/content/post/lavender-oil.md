## Benefits of Lavender Oil



While the list of Lavender benefits is extensive, it is most popular as an aromatherapy treatment. When inhaled, [lavender oil helps induce sleep](http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/2009/LavenderSleep.htm). As such, it is often prescribed as an alternative treatment of insomnia. 

Studies on elderly patients have revealed that it helps increase sleep regularity without the use of sleep medications. 

Lavender essential oils are also a very effective in relieving pain. Postoperative studies have shown that when lavender essential oil is combined with oxygen, it significantly [reduces the amount of pain experienced](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/838.html) upon awakening after surgery compared to those awakening with just oxygen.  

Lavender is frequently used in massage oils for sore/tense muscles as well as rheumatism and backaches. 

Dermatologists recognize lavender oil’s ability to aid in the healing of acne. As someone who has struggled intensively with acne during early teenage years, I can attest to the fact that Lavender essential oil truly does provide relief for the irritated skin and sores. It works by inhibiting the bacteria that causes the initial infection giving the skin a chance to heal. 



## Lavender Oil Uses



The most popular use of lavender oil is aromatherapy due to its relaxing effect. It does, however, blend well with other essential oils such as [cedarwood](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/cedarwood-essential-oil/), pine, and nutmeg. 

Many products use lavender for aromatherapy massage oils, gels, infusion, lotions, and soaps.

In addition, lavender oil has been used in perfumes, while the flowers of the plant have used for potpourri for thousands of years.  All uses of lavender essential oils is external. It is not to be ingested. 



## Origins



Lavender oil is derived from [Lavandula angustifolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavandula_angustifolia), also known as Lavandula. This plant has has the appearance of an evergreen woody shrub that grows to about three feet in height. 

The leaves of the Lavender plant are narrow and linear and gray-green in color, while the flowers are a vibrant purple-blue. It grows well all throughout the Mediterranean region, but its main producer is France. 

The oil is extracted from the flowers of the plant using the process of [steam distillation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_distillation). During steam distillation, the flowers are placed in a still while steam is applied over them. The steam opens the pockets in which the aromatic oils of the plant are kept. These aromatic molecules are released from the oil and quickly evaporate into the steam. 

Then the steam then cooled and condensation of the oil and water occurs. The water and oil are then separated and the oil extraction is complete. 

While the variety Lavandula anguvstifolia is the most common species harvested for essential oil, lavender comes in many varieties leading to similar essential oils on the market. Other varieties of lavender used include [Lavandula latifolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavandula_latifolia). 

This species of lavender grows at lower altitudes and has a strong odor. This variety is used in fragrance blends and is effective for headache treatments, insect repellant, and rheumatic pain.

## What are the medicinal properties of eucalyptus oil?



Cineole, which is the main ingredient of the eucalyptus essential oil, has some extraordinary properties. Some of these properties are:

**Stimulant:** Eucalyptus is especially helpful in increasing mental alertness and body activeness. Cineole increases the blood circulation in the body and stimulates the receptor cells in the nerve endings for better response. It is an excellent natural anti-depressant.

**Vasodilator:** The vapors of the volatile oil help increase the blood circulation in the arteries. Increased blood circulation is useful in conditions like asthma, respiratory problems, heart conditions and diabetes.

**Anti-inflammatory:** This property helps in treating joint and muscular pains.

**Antiseptic:** Some properties like antiseptic, anti-bacterial and antispasmodic are almost common among all the essential oils. These properties help cure small wounds, burns and minor infections.



## What are the health benefits?



**Respiratory Problems:** Most respiratory problems are either due to the blockage of the respiratory tract from cough and cold or because of presence of germs and bacteria in the same. The vapors have some very strong anti-microbial properties which kill the germs and bacteria in the respiratory tract and are thus very helpful in treating asthma. Also, inhaling eucalyptus oil with warm water clears nasal blockades. 

**Multi-purpose Pain Relief:** Topically applying a few drops can relieve you of your muscular pain, inflation, headaches and migraines. The cineole present in the oil increases the blood circulation and relaxes your muscles. It also instantly soothes your nerves to give you an instant relief from pain and inflation.

**Oral Hygiene:** The non-toxic nature and presence of cineole make eucalyptus oil a very good natural oral hygiene product. Its natural germ and bacteria killing property and an exotic aroma has made it an essential ingredient in many oral care products such as mouth washes and toothpastes. 

**Baby Care:** Eucalyptus oil has a very gentle and soothing effect on the skin and can fight certain skin infections and prevent bacterial growth in case of minor cuts and burns. Regularly use eucalyptus oil baby wipes for a soft skin and to avoid skin rashes and infections. Apply a few drops on the chest to treat congestion and common cold and cough.



## What are the common uses of eucalyptus oil?



Apart from the above mentioned benefits, some of the other important benefits include:





  * Eucalyptus oil is extremely helpful in bronchitis. Regularly massage on the chest or inhale a few drops with steam for long lasting relief.


  * Use as a natural room freshener at home, workspace or school to increase blood circulation and mental awareness


  * People with heart conditions, asthma and diabetes should daily massage their body with a eucalyptus oil lotion. Because of its natural arterial vasodilator properties it increases the blood circulation.


  * It can be used as a natural substitute for chest congestion, nasal blockage and other cough and cold problems.





## Where to Buy



Mainly, there are 5 types of eucalyptus oils with slightly different properties. For general uses, buy locally at Amazon. But the best and purest form comes from Australia and Ooty, India.

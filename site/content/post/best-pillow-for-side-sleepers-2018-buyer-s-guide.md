If you are a side sleeper, not just any pillow will do. In fact, if you use a pillow that does not have enough support for your head you could end up serious neck and back pain.



So which brand is the best pillow for side sleepers? 



<strong>We believe the <em>Simmons Beautyrest Latex Foam Pillow</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BI5HGS//?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) offers the greatest support and comfort for the price.</strong>



However, our research didn't stop there. We reviewed over a dozen pillows designed for side sleepers that we organized into 2 basic categories: traditional memory foam and all-natural materials. 



<strong>Which type of pillow do you prefer:</strong>

<ul>

<li><a href="#traditional">Traditional Memory Foam</a></li>

<li><a href="#natural">All-Natural</a></li>

</ul>



When you sleep on your side, extra pressure is put on your neck and shoulders. You need a firm pillow that will support and keep your neck in line with your spine throughout the night.



Having not enough or even too much support can irritate your muscles and nerves, causing you pain and discomfort throughout the following day.



If you've spent anytime trying for find a new pillow, you probably realize that there are dozens of options and new brands popping up almost everyday. 



To make this decision easier, we reviewed the top rated brands to help you sort through the fluff - no pun intended.

<h2 id="traditional">Best Memory Foam Pillows for Side Sleepers</h2>



The most popular type of pillow for side sleepers is made out of a solid piece of memory foam or is filled with shredded memory foam. 



In contrast to solid foam pillows that are firm and rigid, shredded memory foam is softer and more forgiving to the shape of your head and neck. If you've tried a solid memory foam pillow in the past that was too firm, it might be time to try a shredded memory foam pillow.



After reviewing over 10 different traditional style pillows we narrowed our selection of the best memory foam pillows for side sleepers down to just 3 brands. These include Coop Home Goods, SleepBetter and ClassicBrands.



<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods Shredded Memory Foam Pillow</a></h3>



<img src="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/coop_home_goods_pillow-150x150.jpg" alt="coop home goods pillow" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12743" />The <em>Coop Home Goods pillow</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) is filled with a soft, yet supportive shredded memory foam. If you prefer a cool pillow over a warm pillow, shredded memory foam is a good option. It allows air to circulate through the pillow and keep the temperature comfortable throughout the night.



Another unique advantage of a shredded memory foam pillow is that it gives you the opportunity to add or remove foam as needed. If the pillow is too tall or firm, just unzip the cover and remove a handful of foam.



This is one reason Coop Home Goods likes to call their product "The People's Pillow" - it can be adjusted to fit almost any comfort level.



The foam inside the Coop Home Goods pillow has been certified by CertiPUR-US meaning it has been tested for performance, durability and harmful chemicals.



We're not the only ones that like it. It has received over ten thousand reviews on Amazon.

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK7MPG/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SleepBetter Contoured Memory Foam Pillow</a></h3>



<img src="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sleepbetter_contoured_pillow-150x150.jpg" alt="sleepbetter contoured pillow" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12744" />We selected the <em>SleepBetter Contoured pillow</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK7MPG/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) as the best option for side sleepers that like a firm pillow. In contrast to shredded memory foam, a solid memory foam pillow offers greater support and firmness.



This pillow made our list because it offered enough support without going flat and had a decent weight that other pillows lacked.



The SleepBetter brand likes to mention that their pillow cover is designed with Phase Change Material (PCM) beads to regulate temperature. Unfortunately, these beads did not keep the pillow cool enough throughout the night. We consider this a marketing gimmick, rather than an actual benefit.



Keep in mind that a solid memory foam tends to stay warmer throughout the night because they have no air circulation. If you like a warm pillow, this might be for you.



However, if you like a cool pillow throughout the night you should consider our shredded memory foam pillow suggestion or a latex foam pillow.

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043L17NG/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic Brands Conforma One-Piece Memory Foam Pillow</a></h3>



<img src="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/classic_brands_solid_foam_pillow-150x150.jpg" alt="classic brands solid foam pillow" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12745" />We highly recommend the <em>Classic Brands Conforma One-Piece Memory Foam pillow</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043L17NG/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) if you want extra support and love a firm pillow. 



One-piece foam pillows are the most popular style for side sleepers. They offer consistent support and thickness which you need if you sleep on your side.



Unlike shredded memory foam pillows, the one-piece version will not flatten overtime or become lumpy.



Like we mentioned earlier about memory foam temperature, only purchase this pillow if you like a warm pillow throughout the night. Solid foam pillows do not circulate air, which causes them to trap body heat and stay warm to the touch.

<h2 id="natural">Best Natural Pillows for Side Sleepers</h2>



Just because you sleep on your side and require additional neck support doesn't mean you have to compromise your environmentally friendly lifestyle.



Thankfully there are a few brands that have created pillows just for you. One of the most popular types of natural pillows is filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat" target="_blank">buckwheat hulls</a>.



<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DJG7T9G/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hullo Buckwheat Pillow</a></h3>



<img src="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hullo_buckwheat_pillow-150x150.jpg" alt="hullo buckwheat pillow" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12746" />We selected the <em>Hullo Buckwheat pillow</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DJG7T9G/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) as one of our favorite natural pillows for side sleepers. While more expensive than other pillow brands, we believe it's quality made up for its price many times over.



Not familiar with Buckwheat? Neither were we.



What we found out is that Buckwheat is a seed covered in a shell and is not technically a grain or wheat. 



Since the Buckwheat seed is considered a fruit rather than a grain, it's actually gluten-free. 



(A gluten-free pillow - what is this world coming to?) ;)



After the Buckwheat seed is processed and turned into buckwheat flour, the hull can be used as filling in a pillow. 



Most commonly found in China, Buckwheat pillows are popular because the filling is natural and keeps your head cool while you sleep. It is also firm enough to give you plenty of support if you sleep on your side.



The Buckwheat filling won't flatten like memory foam and is very durable. It is not uncommon for a buckwheat pillow to last twice as long as a traditional cotton pillow.



If you are new to the world of Buckwheat pillows there are a few things to keep in mind before you decide to try one. 



First, the Buckwheat hulls make noise if you toss and turn during the night. If you are sensitive to noise, this pillow may not be for you. 



Also, since the filling is made from organic material it cannot be machine washed.

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BI5HGS/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simmons Beautyrest Latex Foam Pillow</a></h3>



<img src="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/simmons_beautyrest_latex_pillow-150x150.jpg" alt="simmons beautyrest latex pillow" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12747" />Last on our list, but definitely not least. We selected the <em>Simmons Beautyrest Latex Foam Pillow</em> (<a href="

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BI5HGS/?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check price</a>) as the best pillow for side sleepers for many reasons.



Latex foam pillows offer excellent neck support for side sleepers because they are very firm and will not flatten overtime like memory foam pillows. 



These pillows frequently get higher ratings for firmness and comfort over traditional memory foam pillows, making them one of the best choices for side sleepers.



The natural latex foam is made from the sap of the tropical rubber tree. If you are concerned about pathogens or odors, this pillow may be for you.



This pillow is antimicrobial, making it a clean alternative to hard-to-clean cotton pillows. Plus it comes with a pillow cover that is machine washable, however the pillow itself must be spot cleaned.



If you have a latex allergy, you should avoid this type of pillow. Allergic reactions to Latex are more common in adults over the age of 40. That being said, less than 1% of the general population reports having an allergic reaction to latex so it is less common than you might think.

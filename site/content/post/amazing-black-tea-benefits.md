Black tea is very popular and may be the most common tea consumed on a daily basis. According to statistics black tea accounts for 91% of all tea sold in the West. It comes from the same plant as white and green tea but is distinct due to a different processing method. 

**What makes it so popular? Its caffeine content, amazing health benefits, and rich smooth flavor.** 



## Benefits of Drinking Black Tea



Black tea benefits are most potent when the tea is drunk without any additives such as sugar or milk. Its studies range from oral health, digestive, heart, and immune system benefits. 

When taken by itself without additives, black tea helps reduce plaque formation and cuts down on cavity causing bacteria. Black tea also has huge benefits for heart health. Those who drink 3 or more cups of black tea a day are 21% less likely to have a stroke than those who do not. 

Black is also laden with antioxidants known as polyphenols. These polyphenols help remove free radicals from our body. Left unchecked these free radicals lend to a host of diseases, premature aging of the skin and cancer. Studies have shown that those who drink black tea regularly have a lower chance of developing ovarian cancer, all thanks to these powerful antioxidants. 

Drinking this type of tea tends to be relaxing and stress relieving due to the presence of an amino acid known as L-Theanine. Studies indicate that drinking the tea regularly can help lower the stress hormone cortisol as well as the risk of diabetes. 



## Nutrients



Though name black tea, the color more closely resembles a dark red, which is why the Chinese call this type of tea as red tea. In terms of taste, black tea boasts of a rich savory taste. 

Drinking the tea provides antioxidants and polyphenols, theanine, caffeine, as well as vitamins and minerals. These included Vitamin C, carotene, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, Folic acid, manganese, potassium, and fluoride.  

The caffeine content of black tea varies on the variety but the general standard is 23-110 mg per cup of tea. This is less than the standard 90-175 mg of caffeine found in a cup of coffee. 

Black tea is considered safe for most individuals and is only potentially harmful when you drink more than 4 or 5 cups a day due to the caffeine content. Too much caffeine may cause headaches, jittery feeling, nausea and vomiting, ringing in ears, and sleeplessness. 



## Origin of Black Tea



The tea is derived from the same plant as white and green tea. However, black tea is withered, rolled, and then allowed to ferment. It is thought to originate in China but today grows in many countries including India. 

There are several similar varieties on the market. The differences between these varieties is generally based on differences in location and harvest methods, for example harvested in spring vs summer. Examples of varieties includes: Darjeeling black tea, Keemun and Assam.

Recycled paper countertops made by brands such as Paperstone, Shetkastone, Richlite and EcoTop are becoming popular alternatives to traditional countertop materials.





Not familiar with paper composite countertops? They are exactly what they sound like.





Paper countertops, like Paperstone, are made from 100% post consumer recycled materials. The recycled paper is mixed with a non-toxic resin and pressed under heat until it turns into a dense, stone-like surface.





Still not convinced Paperstone countertops are right for your kitchen? Read our top 9 reasons why we love recycled paper countertops.





## Environmentally Friendly



One of the main reasons we like Paperstone countertops is because they are very environmentally friendly. The countertops are made from either 100% post consumer recycled paper or a combination recycled materials and pulp from FSC-certified forests.

Another benefit of using recycled paper for your countertops is that they are a renewable resource. While [granite and marble](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/marble-vs-granite/) are both beautiful, the sad fact is that we only have a limited amount these materials available on our planet. Once they're gone, they're gone for good.

On the other hand, we have an almost limitless supply of recycled paper since it is made from tree pulp, which is considered a renewable resource.



## Food-Safe



Cooking and eating on a paper surface doesn't sound like it would be clean, does it? Well, you'd be wrong. 

Paper countertops are safe for direct food contact. The Paperstone brand has even been certified by the [National Sanitary Foundation](http://www.nsf.org/).

The resin used in the countertops is non-toxic and VOC-free, so you don't have to worry about it coming into contact with your food. You'll also be happy to know that when properly cleaned, your paper countertops will not promote the growth of bacteria in your kitchen.



## Non-Porous



One advantage of solid surface countertops, including those made from paper, is that they are non-porous. Whereas, [granite](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/complete-granite-countertops-guide/) and [marble](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/complete-guide-marble-countertops/) are naturally very porous materials. 

**This is important because non-porous surfaces are easier to clean and offer fewer places for bacteria to hide.**

Natural stone countertops must be cleaned and sealed frequently to prevent bacteria and mold from growing within the pores of the surface.



## Stain and Heat Resistant



Speaking of being a non-porous surface, another reason we like paper countertops is because they are stain resistant. This is primarily due to the fact that Paperstone countertops are a solid surface material. There are no pores for oils to absorb into.

If you've ever spilled anything on a granite surface, you may already know how easy it can get stained. Even water will leave a dark spot on granite for a few minutes until it evaporates.

We also like the fact that paper countertops are heat resistant up to 350 degrees fahrenheit. 



## Lighter than Natural Stone



A 1 1/4" thick slab of Paperstone weighs about 9 pounds per square foot. The same size piece of granite weighs over twice that amount!

Why does this matter?

Well, the advantage of using a lighter material is that it can span longer distances without extra support. Plus, less weight also means lower shipping costs and cheaper installation prices.



## Very Durable



Did you know composite paper surfaces were originally used to build ramps in skate parks?

If a recycled paper surface can withstand the abuse of teenagers on skateboards, then it will be strong enough for your kitchen as well. 

While these countertops are durable you should avoid cutting directly on them. Overtime they will develop a textured patina on the surface from dings, dent and scratches.

I should also point out that paper countertops are not as brittle as stone or [engineered quartz](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/quartz-vs-granite-countertops/), so they are less likely to crack.



## Can Be Refinished



Although Paperstone is not indestructible, it can be easily refinished. If you grow tired of the natural dings and scratches that accumulate overtime, you can easily sand and reseal the surface. 

After you finish sanding, all you need to do is apply a coat of mineral oil or a combination of beeswax and oil to keep them looking brand new. 



## Many Different Colors



Paper countertops are available in a wide range of colors to match your decor. The Paperstone brand offers 11 different colors including: 





  * Cabernet


  * Gunmetal


  * Slate


  * Chocolate


  * Leather


  * Sienna


  * Denim


  * Mocha


  * Graphite


  * Pewter


  * Sand



However, if you are looking timeless countertop colors you should only consider using dark tones like Slate or light color options such as Sand.



## Made in USA



Did you know beautiful pieces of marble and granite have to be shipped halfway across the world from India or Italy before they can be installed in your kitchen? Doesn't that seem like a waste of energy and resources?

What if there was a natural countertop material you could use that was made in the United States? Yep, you guessed it, I'm talking about Paperstone!

All of the materials used in creating recycled paper countertops, including the resin, is sourced from within the United States. The countertops are manufactured locally as well. This is not only good for the environment, but it's also great for our economy!



## Conclusion


As you can see there are many reasons to love recycled paper countertops. Not only are they environmentally friendly, but the are also beautiful.

But don't write them off as an option just because you don't think a paper surface is as durable as natural stone. Remember, composite paper surfaces were originally used to build ramps in skate parks!

Finally, we wanted to remind you that these countertops are also non-porous, meaning it won't stain or harbor bacteria if properly cleaned.

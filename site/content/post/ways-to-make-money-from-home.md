## Start a Blog



![wordpress logo](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress_logo-150x150.png)Starting a blog is one of the most popular ways to make money working from home. That being said, it's not necessarily the easiest. However, it could give you the financial freedom you're looking for.

For example, there are quite a few blogs that report their income each month with detailed breakdowns of how they made money working from home. Here are a few of their latest income reports:





  * PinchofYum.com: $58,465 (8/16)


  * MakingSenseofCents.com: $102,911 (9/16)


  * SmartPassiveIncome.com: $167,314 (9/16)



Don't forget, those numbers are monthly income reports! Yes, you read that right. Those bloggers are earning more per month than most people earn in a year.

## Complete Online Surveys



Did you know companies will pay to hear your opinion about their products? 

This information is valuable to companies before they launch new products or spend millions trying to advertise new products nobody wants. 

That's why companies are willing to pay their potential customers to fill out surveys - they get valuable insights about their products.

When you sign up online to take surveys, you can start earning money right away. Usually you can earn a few dollars just for completing your profile!

After your profile is complete, you will start getting invitations to fill out surveys for rewards and cash. Companies use your profile to determine if you are one of their potential customers. Make sure you fill out your profile based on your interests and lifestyle. Most importantly, be honest.

**Think surveys sound like a great way to earn extra money working from home?**



## Use Alternative Search Engines



![bing logo](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bing_logo-150x150.png)If you're like most people, you probably use Google as your primary search engine. In fact, more than **100 BILLION searches** are performed on Google each month!

However, there are dozens of other great search engines out there. The best part is that some of them will actually pay you to use their website. _How cool is that?_

**A few examples include:**





  * Bing


  * Inbox Dollars


  * Swagbucks



To get started you'll need to sign up for an account at each search engine and complete your profile. Then, all you need to do is start searching. Each search can earn you a few points which can be redeemed for cash or rewards.



## Sell Handmade Items on Etsy



![etsy logo](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/etsy_logo-150x150.jpg)Do you like crafting or DIY projects? Well, selling your crafts on Etsy could net you some serious cash. Etsy is a marketplace for handmade or vintage items, jewelry, and art. 

Do you have a signature handmade item like a knitted scarf or painting that your friends love? Then, you might have what it takes to become an Etsy super seller.

Not sure what to sell on Etsy? No worries. Etsy makes it easy for us to find out which shops and products are popular. On each seller's page it will tell you how many people have favorited their products and in some cases will even tell you how many products have been sold.

Of course, popular products will have more competition, but competition is a good thing in business. It means there are people that want to buy what you're selling. If there's no competition for the product you want to sell, it probably means no one wants to buy that product.



## Resell Items on eBay



![ebay logo](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ebay_logo-150x150.png)Do you like going to garage or estate sales on the weekend? If you know how to spot a diamond in the rough, you could make extra money reselling items on eBay.

eBay is an online auction and ecommerce website that allows people to sell collectibles, home decor, computers, furnishings, vehicles, and millions of other items. Almost anything can be sold on eBay as long as it is not illegal and does not violate eBay's policies.

Although you can sell brand new items on eBay, you can make more money selling used items and collectibles. If you think you have what it takes to make extra money working from home, you should try your hand as an eBay seller.

A simple way to get started is to look in your garage or attic for collectible or antique items. Then, get them cleaned up and photographed using good lighting. Post your items on eBay with or without a reserve and see what happens. 

If you have success and enjoy the process, next you'll need to start purchasing additional items to sell. These can be products you find at garage sales, estate sales or listed on Craigslist.



## Complete Freelance Tasks



![upwork logo](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/upwork_logo-150x150.png)The fact is that computers have become a huge part of our lifestyles. For anyone that wants to make extra money working from home this means there are more opportunities than ever before. 

Companies that need small or ongoing projects completed are turning to freelancers all over the world for help instead of hiring a full-time employee.

Businesses and sole proprietors are always looking for help on freelance websites such as Upwork.com, Freelancer.com and Guru.com.

To get started you'll need to create a free profile and begin looking for jobs that you can complete. There are dozens of categories to search through including writing and editing, social media, web design, customer service, and many more.

When you apply to your first job, you may get discouraged by the amount of freelancers that apply. Sometimes 20 to 50 people might apply for the same project. Don't worry. If you have a great profile with samples of your work and have great communication, you have a good shot at getting work. You might not get every project you apply for, but you will get enough to keep you busy.

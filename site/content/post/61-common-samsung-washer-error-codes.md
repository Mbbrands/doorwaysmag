Having problems with your Samsung washing machine?



<strong>Use our list of common Samsung washer error codes to find out what's wrong and how to fix it.</strong>



These error codes apply to both top-load and front load washing machines. You may notice that we've listed several error codes for each problem. Depending on the age of your washer, you may see a different error code. 



Unfortunately, when Samsung changes their appliance design and as technology improves, so do their error codes. This can make it difficult to sort out which error code you are seeing and the possible problem.



If you don't see your error code below, or have a question about your specific model please let us know.

<h2>Common Problems</h2>



In our experience with washing machine repair, there are only a few problems that cause the majority of error codes you might see. 



One of the easiest problems to fix is when you get a door error. If the door on a front-loading washer is open or ajar it will trigger a fault code. This can be easily fixed by making sure the door is completely closed.



Another problem we see frequently is when the washing machine load is unbalanced or needs to be stabilized. 



When loading your washer with clothes, make sure they are evenly spread out and there are not too many heavy items on the same side. A heavy sweater, coat or even jeans can cause the washer to become unbalanced and trigger an error code. 



This problem can be easily solved by rearranging the clothes and restarting the cycle.



<strong>Most frequent Samsung washing machine problems:</strong>



<ul>

<li>Door is open or stuck closed</li>

<li>Load is unbalanced</li>

<li>Water connection problems</li>

<li>Clogged drain</li>

</ul>



Note: To avoid risk of electrical shock or injury, disconnect power to washing machine before servicing.



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



If you are uncomfortable working on your Samsung washer, you should call a certified technician to diagnose and repair the machine. 



Although many of the error codes we listed can be easily fixed with a few basic tools and common sense, it may be safer to call a professional.



As always, the error codes were provided as information only and were not intended as repair advice. When in doubt about the problem with your washing machine, you should call the manufacturer or retailer where you purchased the machine.

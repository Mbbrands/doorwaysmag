![how to cook rice](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/how_to_cook_rice.jpg)

A rice cooker is one appliance that no household should be without. This small appliance which looks a lot like a small crock pot, is typically used to cook rice in a manner that is simple and foolproof. 

They come in a wide variety of sizes to choose from which makes it easy to find one to fit any need and budget. 

One of the chief benefits that come from a rice cooker is that it ensures rice is cooked perfectly each time by simply adding the proper amount of rice and water to the pot. The rice cooker automatically cooks the rice at the proper temperature until it is done and keeps it warm until it is ready to serve.  

The best rice cookers take the guesswork out of cooking rice and allow you to focus your attention on other things without having to worry if the rice will be overdone, underdone, or stuck to the bottom of the pot. 

People who are used to cooking rice by the boil-in-the-bag method enjoy using rice cookers with traditional rice because it is more economical.

There are rice cooker models which function like a crock pot by allowing you to cook a broader range of food as well. Like a crock pot, rice cookers only require some counter space and an electrical connection which frees up room on the stove for cooking other items.  

Besides having a warming feature, many of these appliances come with an insert that gives you the ability to steam cook other foods like tamales and veggies as well.  

**Here are a few of the most popular models on the market to check out and help familiarize yourself with this type of product:**

Let me start by saying that I love to barbecue. 

I can say from experience that if you want the best tasting smoked meats and vegetables, you'll need a great electric smoker. 

But, which one should you buy? 

If you've spent anytime searching for smoker reviews online, you'll know that getting honest advice is harder than it should be. There are an overwhelming number of generic websites with anonymous reviews. 

Who's behind those reviews and why should you trust them?

That's why I wanted to share what I've learned about electric smokers over the last few years. Not only am I an experienced cook and captain of the grill, but I'm also an architectural consultant and internationally recognized designer. 

I love to help homeowners design and build their dream homes. Most architects think home design only includes building walls and a roof, then calling it a day. I think your dream home includes everything inside as well. 

That's why I wanted to share this recommendation with you.

Before we go any further, why should you choose an electric smoker in the first place? 

Well, in my house it's all about safety and convenience. Unlike propane and charcoal smokers, you don't have to worry about anything going wrong. 

**You can plug it in, turn it on and enjoy.** 

Safety is just one reason why I love to smoke food, but the flavor is what keeps me coming back for more. So, without further ado, here's my pick for the best smoker (updated continuously).



## Top Pick: Masterbuilt 30-Inch Electric Smoker with Window



[![masterbuilt 30 electric smoker](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/masterbuilt_30_electric_smoker_reviews-300x300.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4)If you are new to smoking, the [Masterbuilt 30-inch electric smoker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4) is a great place to start for beginners. Once you set the temperature, all you have to do is wait. 

You'll never have to worry about over or under smoking your meat, again. 

The same goes for advanced cooks as well. Just because this isn't your first time using a smoker doesn't mean you should have to mess around with the settings to get the perfect flavor. 

The ease of use will help take your cooking skills to the next level, so you can focus on preparing your side dishes or spending time with your family.

Among all of the electric smokers on the market, why did I choose Masterbuilt as my top pick? 

To be honest, I love companies that produce great products, but that also share my same values. Masterbuilt is a family owned company that has been in business since 1973. Their first company core value is:



<blockquote>Faith, Family and the restâ€¦</blockquote>



I think that statement speaks loudly about the type of product you'll get from them. Their philosophy is less about maximizing profit and more about producing a great electric smoker, among other high-quality items.



## How to Choose the Best Electric Smoker



When shopping for a new smoker there are two primary obstacles you'll be faced with. The first question is size - how much space do you need?

The [Masterbuilt 30-inch is 33.5 inches tall and 19.6 inches wide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4). That gives you enough space inside to smoke almost any food your heart desires - a total of 700 square inches! If you still need more room, the [Masterbuilt 40-inch model has a whopping 900 square inches of internal space.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTMTCG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTMTCG&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=7NO2U6X3FQGFSNYN)

The second thing you'll need to look for is temperature settings. This smoker has a maximum temperature of 275 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Most meats, like brisket, only need to be smoked at 225 degrees. However, chicken and turkey need to be heated at around 250 degrees. 

Getting an accurate temperature reading is important to making sure your food gets the right amount of flavor and tenderness. Thanks to the digital remote control you can guarantee that your food is smoked for the right time and the perfect temperature. In fact, you can adjust the setting from inside your home using the Radio Frequency (RF) remote up to 100 feet away.



## Clean Up & Wood Chips



[![best electric smoker](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/best_electric_smoker-300x300.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJZ150/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FJZ150&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=XXZ3UWIZAKV3G76V)One aspect of smoking that I love so much is how easy it is. You just set it and forget it. However, you'll still have some cleanup to do when it's all over. 

The Masterbuilt models include chrome plated racks that can go directly in the dishwasher for easy cleanup. 

On the front of the smoker you'll notice there's a new drip deflector and a front access drip pan to help you collect any run off liquid. You can easily pour out the liquid and easily rinse out the drip pan the next tip you go to use it again.

Continuing on with my obsession with how easy this smoker is to use, it's very simple to add chips during the smoking process. This Masterbuilt brand smoker has a special side loader for chips. It allows you to add more chips once they've stopped producing smoke, without having to open the front door. 

Thanks to their ingenious design you won't lose any valuable heat or moisture during the most important part of the smoking process. 



## Accuracy & Temperature



One of the benefits of using a digital smoker is that you will always get consistent and accurate smoking results. To make sure your meats are cooked all the way through, this model includes a meat probe that will tell you the internal temperature right on your remote.

Whether you decide to purchase the [30-inch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4) or [40-inch model](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4), both take up a decent amount of space. Each model has a handle and wheels to make it easy for you to move around and store when you're finished cooking.

**On a side note, the Masterbuilt smoker comes only with a basic instruction manual.** If you want more detailed recipes and smoking tips you should pick up one of my favorite cookbooks, too.

I wanted to publish this review quickly because there is a great deal on this smoker available online for a limited time only. Even if you're on the fence about this model, I'd encourage you to give it a try. Masterbuilt has an awesome [90 day warranty](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZTN01K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007ZTN01K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=T7ACE32I737OG6D4) to help give you peace of mind that your new smoker will continue to perform years down the road. So, what are you waiting for?

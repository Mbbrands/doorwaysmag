Oolong tea has a very pleasant fragrant smell and fruity flavor making it popular to the taste as well as the body. It boasts of benefits such as the reduction of heart disease, inflammatory disorders, weight loss, and providing powerful antioxidants, to name a few. 

In terms of type, it falls between green tea and black tea, striking a balance between the two. You could say it providing the best of both worlds in one cup. 



## Benefits of Oolong Tea



Who among us does not want to banish extra fat and sport healthy glowing bodies? 

Oolong tea can help this endeavor because it helps control how our bodies metabolize the fat. Studies [have shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220617/) that despite eating a horrible high-fat/high-sugar diet, mice given polyphenols showed a decrease in their overall weight and fat index while the mice who where not given polyphenols did not. 

These [polyphenols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol) are also responsible for removing and binding free radicals found in our bodies. These free radicals have the potential to do great damage and contribute to many diseases and several forms of cancer. By drinking oolong tea you can remove them from your system and help reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and cancer.

The antioxidants found in oolong tea promote apoptosis in stomach related cancerous growths and stop the activation of carcinogenic cells and genotoxic agents before they become effective and wreck havoc in your body. 

Some studies believe that the polyphenols found in oolong tea double as anti-allergenic compounds. This helps reduce and eliminate irritation and chronic skin problems. Individuals suffering from eczema often see results by drinking 3 cups of tea daily. 



## Nutrients



This tea is full to the brim of antioxidants. It includes minerals such as copper, selenium, potassium manganese, and carotin. 

Vitamins such as A, B, C, E, and K can also be found within its leaves. In addition to minerals and vitamins, oolong tea contains folic acid, niacin amide, and alkaloids which have detoxifying properties. The tea contains caffeine as well as theophylline and theobromine, which also stimulate the nervous system and provide some energy 

Because of its caffeine content, you should drink the tea in moderation and no more than 5 cups per day. some individuals are more sensitive to caffeine and may experience the negative side effects of caffeine of sooner than others. 

Too much caffeine can cause headaches, anxiety, loss of sleep, irregular heartbeat, and a host of other unpleasant side effects. Pregnant women and those that are breastfeeding should also limit it to 2 cups due to the caffeine content. 

With its fragrant aroma, almost fruity, smooth, distinct flavor, and health benefits, there is no debate that oolong tea is a great beverage to go to. 



## Origin



Oolong tea, like green tea, originates from China and dates back almost 400 years. It is a mix between green tea and black tea, as the leaves are only partially fermented. Today it is cultivated all over the world in tropical/subtropical regions. 

The plant itself is an evergreen shrub of the genus Camellia. There are two varieties: Camellia sanensis which is frequently used to produce Chinese teas,  and Camellia saneness assamica which produces Indian Assam Teas.

For those that like to be precise there are 11 known varieties of oolong tea with slight differences in how it was harvested and processed.



## Where to Buy



Oolong tea is sold in Wegmans, Giant,  Walmart, Walgreens, and most other major grocery stores. The typical quantity of a box of tea bags is 1.50 oz (42 g) and the average cost is between $3 to $6 dollars per box. 

Organic and loose leaves are harder to found in typical stores but can be found online. They tend to be much pricier and sell in quantities of 2 oz which is equivalent to 25-30 teaspoons. This quantity usually sells for $20 and up.

## Benefits of Rosehip Seed Oil



**Moisturizing and Scar Treatment**

Rosehip Seed Oil is used for cosmetic purposes only. Its unique composition is made up of 77% essential fatty acids. It is also very high in linoleic/linolenic acids, as well as vitamins A and C. 

This composition makes it extremely effective against dry or dehydrated skin and hair. Its properties help regenerate tissue, minimize wrinkles and fine lines as well as sun damage and stretch marks. 

Through regular application, this oil can help prevent premature aging and will sooth and heal the skin. 

When applied to young scars, it prevents the formation of keloid scar tissue, minimizing the scars appearance while rejuvenating the skin. 

**Skin and Nail Conditions**

In addition to moisturizing the skin, rosehip seed oil helps heal age spots, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and brittle nails. It is also a very effective treatment for burns. 



## Uses



Rosehip seed oil is intended for cosmetic use through topical applications. It is a very gentle oil and can be used undiluted. It is often incorporated into creams, massage oils, and lotions. It is safe and has no known side effects. 

Due to its deep hydration, this oil may not be for those with oily skin as it may exasperate the problem. 

It is also not recommended for direct application on acne as it can clog the pores and lead to further breakouts. It can however, be used on scars left by acne. 



## Origin



Rosehip seed oil originates from the southern Andes in Chile where the wild rose bushes thrive. It can also be extracted from the Rosa Canina which is found in South Africa as well as Europe.

The oil is extracted from the seeds of the rose bushes through the process of cold pressing and winterization. 

To extract the oil through cold pressing, the entire seed is mechanically pierced to gain access to the essential oil. It is then pressed to squeeze out all of the juice and oil. 

This mixture is then centrifuged to separate the liquid from the solids. After it is centrifuged, the oil is separated from the juice and is ready for bottling. 

Winterization refers to cooling and filtering the oil even further to remove any solid crystallized fractions. There are two varieties of rosehip seed oil on the market. These include Rosa moschata and Rosa canina. 



## Where To Buy



This type of oil is abundant and fairly cheap. It can be found at most essential oil stores and online providers. Typical quantities of 1 oz sell for as low as $4.36 by Now Foods. 

Be sure to shop and compare prices and features. Quantities of 4 oz often sell for $29.95 by companies such as Insta Naturals, while an 8 oz bottle can bought for $24.75 from Mountain Rose Herbs.

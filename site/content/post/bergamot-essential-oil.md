Bergamot oil is one of the rarest essential oils. That's because it has some special features which makes it a very good natural medicine. 

Unlike most of the essential oils, the bergamot essential oil is extracted from the fruit, rather than the leaves of the plant. In fact, this oil is extracted from the peel of the fruit of the [Bergamot tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange).

Since the oil is extracted from the peel of the fruit, it has a unique light citrus smell. However, the bergamot is also known to be allergic to most people. **Proper medical guidance is advised before its use.** Read on to know the health benefits of bergamot oil.

## Origin:



The bergamot tree from which the bergamot essential oil is extracted is native to Morocco and Corsica. The fact that this tree is generally not found in any other part of the word makes this essential oil rare. Scientifically, the bergamot essential oil is called [Citrus Bergamia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19655295). Apart from Morocco and Corsica, it is only found in a couple more Mediterranean countries but the major production comes from these two countries.

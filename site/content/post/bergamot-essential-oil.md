Bergamot oil is one of the rarest essential oils. That's because it has some special features which makes it a very good natural medicine. 

Unlike most of the essential oils, the bergamot essential oil is extracted from the fruit, rather than the leaves of the plant. In fact, this oil is extracted from the peel of the fruit of the [Bergamot tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange).

Since the oil is extracted from the peel of the fruit, it has a unique light citrus smell. However, the bergamot is also known to be allergic to most people. **Proper medical guidance is advised before its use.** Read on to know the health benefits of bergamot oil.

## Health benefits of Bergamot Essential Oil:



**1. Aromatherapy:** Bergamot essential oil is very common in aromatherapy. Its natural and unique citrus fragrance promotes blood circulation and is also helpful in treating depression and insomnia. 

The oil naturally contains bergaptene which has some tanning effects on the body. This oil is also used to relieve the body from stress and tension.

**2. Cosmetics:** Due to its tons of skin benefits, the bergamot essential oil is used in natural cosmetics. It is very popular ingredient in hand made soaps and bath lotions. However, for cosmetic use, Bergaptene-free bergamot oil is used. You can find a lot of cosmetics featuring this rare essential oil. Make sure to check whether these are Bergaptene-free or not.

**3. Natural antiseptic:** Bergamot oil is a natural antiseptic and hence is used to cure infections. It also helps in treating various UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections).

Today, most of the natural antiseptic ointments contain bergamot essential oil.
 
**4. Pain-relief:** Bergamot oil increases the secretion of specific hormones which reduce the sensitivity towards pain in our nerves. As a result, it helps alleviate pain. Its soothing aroma also helps a person relax. It can be used to reduce headache, muscle pain, joint pains etc. 



## Uses of Bergamot Essential Oil:



**Massage:** The bergamot essential oil can be used as a natural relaxant during body massages. Its special properties provide a soothing feel.

**Deodorant:** The fresh and evergreen fragrance of this oil is used to make deodorants. A very dilute mixture of this oil with water can also be used as a natural deodorant.



## Origin:



The bergamot tree from which the bergamot essential oil is extracted is native to Morocco and Corsica. The fact that this tree is generally not found in any other part of the word makes this essential oil rare. Scientifically, the bergamot essential oil is called [Citrus Bergamia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19655295). Apart from Morocco and Corsica, it is only found in a couple more Mediterranean countries but the major production comes from these two countries. 



## Where to Buy:



Italy and other countries export pure extracted bergamot oil. Locally, it can be bought on Amazon.

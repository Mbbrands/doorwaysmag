<h2>Showerhead Reviews</h2>



<h3>Rain Showerheads</h3>	



Sometimes all it takes to give a room a refreshing look and feel is a small upgrade. Take the bathroom for instance. If you want to revitalize this space, you can start by replacing your current showerhead with a product such as a rain showerhead.



Rainfall showerheads come in various styles and finishes to choose from so it is easy to find one to match or enhance your existing bath décor.



<h3>Dual Showerheads</h3>	



When it comes to getting the most out of your shower time, two heads are almost always better than one.

This is one reason why more and more people are getting rid of their outdated standard showerhead and replacing it with a high quality dual showerhead model.



Ideal for either large or small spaces, a dual showerhead gives you the power to direct the water where you need it so you can experience a more thorough feeling of cleanliness in a fraction of the time compared to a standard showerhead.



<h3>Handheld Showerheads</h3>	



Other than maybe a cup of java, here is hardly anything that is more refreshing in the morning than waking the mind and body up as a gentle spray of water from a handheld showerhead cascades over you. 



However, you do not need to wait until the morning to enjoy a great shower; taking a shower any time of the day or night can be an invigorating experience when you have a handheld showerhead at your disposal.



<h3>High Pressure Showerheads</h3>	



If you are tired of spending an exorbitant amount of time showering due to having a low-pressure water flow, ditch that wimpy showerhead for one that gives you the water pressure you need and deserve. High pressure showerheads give you the pressure you need to get clean while still conserving water and saving you money.



One of the biggest complaints that people have when using some brands of energy-efficient showerhead models is the uneven water flow they receive due to low pressure. It is important to realize that not all high pressure showerheads on the market are the same.



<h3>LED Showerheads</h3>	



LED Showerheads are a wonderful bathroom accessory that not only are able to give you a refreshing shower, they are also a great way to brighten up any day.



These special light-emitting diode showerheads transform the color appearance of the water so that you can enjoy beautiful cascading streams of color even on the gloomiest day.



LED showerheads come in options that include single or multi-color light choices so it is easy to find a color to suit your individual preferences.



<h3>Low Flow Showerheads</h3>	



Although a low flow showerhead may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you are picking out bathroom upgrades, there are a few reasons why you should consider choosing one.



Some people think that low flow equates to low pressure; however, that is not usually the case. More people are finding that water saving showerheads are actually the best choice for their bathrooms.







<h3>Showerhead Filters</h3>	



It goes without saying that the reason anyone takes a shower is to get clean, so it makes sense that filtered shower water gives you the cleanest water possible to do so. For this reason, many shower heads include filters and in order to maintain that feeling of cleanliness, showerhead filters must be eventually be replaced.



Showerhead filters offer many additional benefits as well. Keep reading to find out more.



<h3>Showerhead Speakers</h3>	



What could be more fun than singing in the shower? Singing with the accompaniment of music from a showerhead speaker, that’s what!



Imagine how much fun it would be waking up under a nice warm stream of water while you listen to your favorite tunes. Showerhead speakers utilize a form of wireless technology and come in a number of styles to choose from that are affordable and easy to use.



<h2>Bathroom Accessories</h2>



<h3>Shower Extension Arm</h3>	



One of the things that most people do not want to have to do the first thing in the morning is to fight the position of their showerhead before they are even fully awake.



When it comes to taking a shower in comfort, the position of the showerhead is a key element.



If the showerhead is too high or too low, a shower extension arm could be the cure to those early morning blues.



<h3>Shower Panels</h3>	



If you are no longer feeling good about the way your shower feels or looks, change it. Yes, it is that simple.



Many people are surprised at how easy it is to upgrade the look and feel of their bath by changing out their existing showerhead and replacing it with a shower panel. Shower panels are made to perform the same function as a traditional showerhead, but only in a more extraordinary way.



<h3>Steam Showers</h3>	



Imagine how wonderful it would be to finish off a strenuous day at work and surround yourself with the comforting warmth of a steam room. You sigh wistfully as you picture billowy clouds of steam envelope your body and watch them float away with all the stress of the day.



If all this feels too good to be true, it really isn’t. Many people are already enjoying the comforts of a spa-like steam experience in their very own homes.



<h3>Towel Warmers</h3>	



There is almost nothing better than stepping out of the shower and into the comfort of a nice warm towel.



Towel warmers are easy to use, just plug them in to heat up, set your towels on the included racks or interior compartment, and allow them to warm up while you are showering. These warmers are also great for heating up towels for the face and hands as well.



<h3>Bathroom Fans</h3>	



A bathroom fan may not be the first thing that you think about when upgrading your bathroom; however, it is a very important element that needs to be working properly and efficiently.



Bathroom exhaust fans draw out air from the room so that new air enters and refreshes the space. See what brands received the best reviews:

## Uses of Helichrysum Essential Oil



**Healing Scars:** Helichrysum Essential Oil has excellent healing effects on the skin. Regularly applying this essential oil on your skin may prevent general problems like rashes, scabies and nail infections. Massage with Helichrysum Oil to even out your uneven skin tone. 

Apart from the above mentioned general benefits, Helichrysum is mainly used to treat skin scars. Whatever may be the source of these scars, regular application of this essential oil over the scar for 6 to 8 months will get you the desired results.

**Treat Sports Injuries:** As a parent of active kids you may encounter broken bones, bruises and open wounds. In all these cases, the blood around the area of injury will likely clot.

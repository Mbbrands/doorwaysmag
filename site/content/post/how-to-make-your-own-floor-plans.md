Do you dream of living in a house that is designed to your exact specifications?





You're not alone.





Over 150,000 custom homes are built each year in the United States by homeowners just like you.





Unfortunately the home design process can be both expensive and frustrating if you don't know where to start.





For instance, have you ever looked at floor plans online and ended up overwhelmed by all of the choices?

Some of the most popular house plan websites feature over 50,000 blueprints!





Who has the time to sort through all of those plans to find what they're looking for?





Not to mention, stock floor plans from websites like <em>houseplans.com</em> can cost over $3,000 each!

Another way you can make your own floor plans is with complicated 3D home design software.





Unfortunately, unless you're an architect or a computer wiz, those 3D programs can take months or years to learn, let alone master.

So what should you do instead?





<strong>The answer is to do what architects do: grab a pen and a piece of paper.</strong>





But don't worry, you won't need to be an artist to do this. Heck, you don't even need to be able to draw a straight line.

<h2>Step 1: Identify Your Needs</h2>





The first step in the home design process is to identify what you need in your dream home. This process involves thinking about the areas you don't like in your current or previous homes. 





You will also want to identify the features that you've always wanted, but haven't had.





For example, if your laundry room is currently tucked away in a closet, a dedicated laundry room may be at the top of your list. If you've always wanted a gourmet kitchen, then let's include it in your floor plans!





We will also need to take note of your basic requirements such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. 





Before we start, you should have a good idea of how large your new home will be in terms of square feet. The total amount of square feet will be needed to help us determine your budget and calculate construction costs later down the road.





<strong>The workbook begins by identifying what you want in your dream house:</strong>





<ul>

<li>How many square feet?</li>

<li>How many bedrooms?</li>

<li>How many bathrooms?</li>

<li>Any special features?</li>

</ul>





<h2>Step 2: Create a Bubble Diagram</h2>

Then we help you create a bubble diagram to figure out which rooms should go where.





<strong>A few items we will help you figure out include:</strong>

<ul>

<li>Do you want an open concept living room?</li>

<li>The master suite on the main floor?</li>

<li>A large laundry room?</li>

</ul>





<h2>Step 3: Design Each Room</h2>





Finally, we'll use the cut and paste section to design your house using premade room layouts.





Just find the kitchen layout you want and cut it out. We'll add it to your floor plan and start designing.





Before you know it your dream house will be coming together right in front of your eyes.





You'll be surprised just how easy it was.



Creating your own floor plans is easy if you know what steps to take. Unfortunately there is a lack of easy to understand information out there about how to design your own house.





That's why we created a workbook called <strong>How to Make Your Own Floor Plans</strong> - to help you through the process of designing your dream home from scratch. 



The best part is that you don't need to know how to draw or need to know how to use fancy 3D software.





In fact, when you complete the workbook you will have floor plan that's drawn to scale.





How cool is that?



<strong>Whether you decide to download our workbook or not, here are the steps to get started designing your own house plans.</strong>





The <strong>Cut &amp; Paste Floor Plans Workbook</strong> normally sells for $29 but today you can get it for just $10!

## Clove Oil Benefits



**Dental:** The most well known use of clove oil is in dental care. This oil has very prominent properties when it comes to treating common dental conditions. Its germicidal properties help alleviate dental pain, sore gums, and mouth sores. 

It contains a special compound known as eugenol, which is a very effective pain reliever. Gargling with diluted clove oil also helps remove bad breath. For this reason dentists often include it in dental products such as toothpastes and mouthwash. 

**Infections:** Due to its antiseptic properties, clove oil is effective in combating fungal infections, and healing wounds, cuts, bruises, and elevating the irritation caused by insect bites. 

**Immune System:** Using clove oil can boost your immune system. Due to its antiviral properties,  clove oil has the ability to purify the blood, increasing your resistance to a host of diseases. Furthermore the antioxidants found in this essential oil help reduce the amount of harmful free radicals in your body minimizing your chances of certain types of cancer and heart disease.



## Common Uses for Clove Oil



Clove oil is often used topically as well as orally. Some cultures, such as Indian and Asian include it in their cultural dishes as a spice. 

In liquid form, it must be diluted before any application to the skin. This is due to the fact that clove oil is very strong and may burn the skin if not properly diluted. As such it is not recommended for those with sensitive skin and those who are pregnant. 

If consumed in a large enough quantity, clove oil can lead to abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and even seizures. The effect is most severe in young children.



## Origin



Clove oil is derived from the aromatic flower buds, leaves, and stems of the Syzygium aromaticum. This clove tree is an evergreen that grows up to 8-12 meters tall. 

These trees are native to Indonesia and the Maluku Islands. They can however, be found in India, Madagascar, Zanzibar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.

The oil itself is generally extracted through the process of steam distillation. This practice runs hot steam over the clove flowers, leaves, or stems to open up the oil pockets. These oils escape into the vapor and are then condensed and separated creating clove essential oil. 



## Popular Varieties



While all clove oil is extracted from the same tree, the part of the tree processed yields different results. As such, clove oil is separated into three types: bud oil, leaf oil, and stem oil. 

The oil from the bud will consist of 60-90% eugenol, the oil from the leaves consists of 82-88% while the oil from the stem consists of the highest eugenol levels, 90-95%. 



## Where to Buy



Typical quantities for clove oil are 0.5 oz and 1 oz  bottles and can be purchased from Simplers Botanicals Essential Oils, Natures Alchemy, Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy, as well as many other essential oil providers. The average price ranges from $3 up to $6.99.

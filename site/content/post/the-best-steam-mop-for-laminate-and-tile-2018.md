A steam mop has many advantages over traditional wet mops or even a Swiffer. For one, you get high-pressure steam delivered on demand that will bust through even the toughest stains. Another benefit is that you don't have to deal with buckets of dirty water or dangerous wet floors.



If keeping your family healthy is important to you, then I should point out that steam mops kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria found in your home.



So, what should you look for when buying a steam mop?



The most helpful features you should be looking for are multiple steam settings, high-quality microfiber mop pads and a removable water tank.

<h2>Bissell 1132A Symphony All-in-One Vacuum and Steam Mop Review</h2>



One thing I've realized over the last few years of running this website is that designing your dream home isn't a destination but a journey. 



Whether you decide to remodel or <a href="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/how-to-design-your-own-house/">design your own house from scratch</a>, you have to keep it looking great even after the construction dust settles.



<strong>That's why I decided put together my pick for the best steam mop - my secret cleaning weapon.</strong> 



When you invest your hard-earned money into <a href="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/laminate-vs-hardwood-flooring/">high quality flooring</a> and <a href="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/ceramic-tile-that-looks-like-wood/">lavish materials</a>, it's important to keep them looking great for years to come.

<p>Not only does it have all the features you'd expect from a steam mop but it's a vacuum, too!</p>



<p>Just like all top rated steam mops it features variable steam control including high and low settings. This gives you the option to use low steam settings for everyday cleaning and high steam when you need to cut through stains.</p>



<p>One of the main reasons to use a steam mop is to help you clean up floor stains and <a href="http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/how-to-clean-grout/" title="How to Clean Grout" target="_blank">grout</a> without having to get down on your hands and knees. And as you probably know, when you have stains it's likely you have crumbs on the floor, too.</p>



<strong>That's why having a vacuum built in is such a lifesaver.</strong>



This model includes microfiber mop pads that you can throw in the washer as soon as you're finished. Even though steam mops kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria, you'll still need to clean the mop pads after every use. Otherwise the pads could collect mold or mildew in between uses.



One of the reasons I like the steam action is because it kills germs without having to use harsh chemicals or cleaners. It does this all with just water!

The Bissell Symphony is meant for serious cleaning action. When you open up the box you'll find 4 microfiber mop pads - 2 soft pads for cleaning and 2 special pads for scrubbing.



It also features a removable water tank for easy filling. This is a huge bonus because most steam mops will only run for about 15 minutes on each tank. If you have a big kitchen or hardwood floors throughout your home, you'll need to refill a few times.



<h2>Shark Steam Mop vs Bissell Symphony</h2>

While I could go on and on about the Bissell Symphony, I realize it is more expensive than other steam mops. If you're looking for an alternative, I suggest looking at the \[easyazon_link asin="B0091YYUAM" locale="US" tag="neighborhoodenvy-20"]Bissell Powerfresh 1940\[/easyazon_link], \[easyazon_link asin="B004Q7CK56" locale="US" tag="neighborhoodenvy-20"]Shark Pocket Steam Mop\[/easyazon_link] or the \[easyazon_link asin="B004Q7CK56" locale="US" tag="neighborhoodenvy-20"]Hoover TwinTank\[/easyazon_link]. All three have over 1,000 reviews on Amazon with an average rating of over 4 stars.



The primary difference is that they do not have vacuum capabilities, but they offer the same steam cleaning power.

Discover Rooibos tea, a herbal tea derived from a bush plant in South Africa. This tea holds a surprising wealth of health benefits making it one of the most popular herbal teas at the moment. 

It helps headaches, insomnia, skin conditions, allergies, and helps protect your skin from premature aging. 



## Benefits of Rooibos Tea



Lacking caffeine, this herbal tea can be consumed in large quantities without any adverse side effects. Instead, it has numerous positive effects on the body. For years it has been used as a medicinal beverage. 

It helps boost the immune system through polyphenols. These polyphenols contain antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. 

The antioxidants in this tea do a wonderful job hunting down free radicals in the body as well as their harmful byproducts and then neutralizing them. This action helps prevent many forms of cancer as well as heart disease. 

This tea is often recommended to those who suffer from sleep problems, stress, and hypertension. Rooibos tea not only acts as a brochodilator which improves breathing problems associated with allergies, and asthma, but also reduces blood pressure protecting you from dangerous cardiovascular diseases and minimizing your chances of suffering a heart attack. 

Rooibos tea is very safe for young children and is very effective in helping with colic and stomach pains. Having two children I can attest to the fact that it does help sooth them and seems to minimize their discomfort. This may be attributed to the antispasmodic properties of the tea. 



## Nutrients



Rooibos tea has a very pleasant sweet, nutty flavor. Dark red in color, this powerful tea contains rare nutrients such as Quercitin and Bioflvanoids. These nutrients are known to help improve circulation. Furthermore, it lacks oxalic acid making it safe for individuals who suffer from kidney stones. 

Rooibos contains many minerals including iron, potassium, calcium, manganeses, fluoride, zinc, alpha hydroxy acid, and magnesium. Antioxidants are abundant including aspalathin, nothofagin, and phenolic compounds. 

Because it is such a powerful tea, it is not recommended for individuals going through chemotherapy or individuals who are going through a hormone sensitive cancer. 



## Origin



Rooibosâ€™s scientific name is Aspalathus linearis.  It originates and is grown in the mountainous area of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  While attempts have been made to grow it in China, Australia, and the US, they have failed making it country and region specific. 

There are two varieties of Rooibos on the market. The most common one is red rooibos, although 
green rooibos sold as well. This green rooibos is often more expensive, though it contains twice the amount of antioxidants and nutrients found in red rooibos. Flavored rooibos tea is also on the market. This type of rooibos is combined with other flavors to create fascinating combinations such as Rooibos Mint, Chamomile, and many other variations. 



## Where to Buy



Because of its popularity, Rooibos is sold in all major grocery stores. It is sold in tea bags by Celestial Seasonings, Numi, and Twinings Herbal Tea to name a few. The typical boxed tea bag quantity is 1.52 oz and sells around an average of $6.  

You can also buy it in loose bulk form in quantities of 8 oz or 16 oz. An 8 oz package sells for an average price of $10.

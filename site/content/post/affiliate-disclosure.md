Hey, Can we talk for a minute? I want to tell you something important. 



By now you may know that the goal of this site has been and always will be about helping homeowners increase the value of their home and have fun along the way. <strong>I'm passionate about this mission.</strong>



I'm also a firm believer that you can do something you're passionate about and make money at the same time, while still making the world a better place. 



Just so we're on the same page I want to let you know that this site participates in affiliate programs and receives money from advertisers.



Affiliate programs allow website owners to receive a commission when someone makes a purchase based on their recommendation. This means that when you click on certain links to various sites that I recommend and make a purchase, this can result in a commission that is credited to this site.



Earning trust is an important part of my values and you have my word that I will only recommend products that I use or have researched thoroughly.

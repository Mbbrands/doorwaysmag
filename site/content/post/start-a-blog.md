**Are you ready to stake your claim of the internet gold rush? One of the most popular ways to [make money online](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/make-money-from-home/) is to start a blog.**





A blog is a website with articles arranged in reverse chronological order. That means the newest articles are at the top of the page.





Many years ago, the term blog was used to describe a "weblog" or online journal.





While the term still applies to journal-style websites today, it has grown to encompass almost any type of website that posts articles on a regular basis. They can be published by one person or an entire staff of writers.





So, how do you start a blog that will help you make money?



**There are 3 essential steps needed to start a blog or build a website:**





  1. Pick a domain name


  2. Purchase website hosting


  3. Install a Content Management System (i.e. Wordpress)

## 1. Pick a Domain Name



Simply put, a domain name is the name of your blog. 

For instance, the domain name of this website is _DoorwaysMagazine.com_.

You can choose any domain name you want, as long as someone else has not already purchased it. 

**Before you start searching for your perfect domain name, here are a few tips to keep in mind:**





  * Only purchase a name ending in .com (not .biz, .info, etc.)


  * Make it memorable


  * Use only 2 or 3 words


  * Don't misspell words


  * Don't use numbers



**Cost:** Available domain names cost around $15 per year to own, but you can get your first domain name for only 99 cents here.



## 2. Purchase Website Hosting



Blogs are really just a bunch of files stored on a computer. When you type in the name of your website, it will display these files in your internet browser. Pretty simple, right?

The computers where your blog files are stored are called "servers." Companies that own website servers are called "hosts."

The next step in starting a blog is to purchase website hosting from a company like GoDaddy, Bluehost or 1and1.

**Cost:** Plans start around $4 per month.



## 3. Set up Your Blog with Wordpress



The final step in starting a blog is to install a content management system (CMS) like Wordpress on your server.

Wordpress is a graphical website framework that makes it easy to create and format articles without needing to know how to code. 

**You can install the Wordpress software with one click and be up and running in under 5 minutes.**

Wordpress is the most popular choice for bloggers because it is easy to customize the look of your website without having to be a designer.

You'll be in good company when you use Wordpress because over 26% of the internet is currently powered by this free CMS

**Cost:** Free!

**Summary of how to start a blog in 3 steps:**





  * Purchase a domain name from GoDaddy


  * Select a basic website hosting plan


  * Install a Wordpress with one-click

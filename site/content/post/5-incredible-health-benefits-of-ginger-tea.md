<h2>Health Benefits</h2>



Ginger tea has so many benefits it’s hard to know where to start. For starters it helps fight ovarian cancer and helps sooth indigestion and IBS, also known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome.



It also plays a role in stimulating your appetite by stimulating your digestive juice production which helps you digest your food more efficiently.



If you are prone to motion sickness, Ginger tea can help eliminate its unpleasant characteristics.



I have personally found it to be very soothing in the mornings during both of my pregnancies. It helped to substantially alleviate my morning sickness as well as help my appetite. Those who suffer from car sickness can greatly benefit from grabbing a mug filled with ginger tea for the car trip.



Additional benefits include pain relief from a host of sources including: arthritis, muscle soreness, menstrual pain, cough, bronchitis, stomach pain, and lower back pain. Some even apply the tea bags or freshly cut ginger to their skin to help treat burns.

Although a low flow showerhead may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you are picking out bathroom upgrades, there are a few reasons why you should consider choosing one. 

Some people think that low flow equates to low pressure; however, that is not usually the case. More people are finding that water saving showerheads are actually the best choice for their bathrooms.

There are many high quality low flow showerhead models on the market that make stunning choices both in looks and in the features they offer. 

Pressure-enhanced showerheads are able to give you a more than adequate water stream without scaling back on luxurious features. Using these showerheads helps you to [conserve energy](http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/our_water/why_water_efficiency.html) which in turn equates to saving money on your utility bills. 

While shopping for a new showerhead you may come across [WaterSense certified](http://www.epa.gov/WaterSense/pubs/faq_showerheads.html) models. This is a program developed by the EPA to recognize showerheads that offer 2.0 GPM or less flow rate. Currently, the federal standard is 2.5 GPM, so you could reduce your water bill by 20 percent with a new shower head. 

You'll notice that all of the low flow heads recommended in this guide meet this 2.0 GPM criteria.

## Company Background



Kitchen Craft has been providing its innovative designs for over 40 years. The company was [founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba](http://www.kitchencraft.com/about) and has since been selling in both the Canadian and American market. In 2002 Kitchen Craft became a subsidiary of [MasterBrand Cabinets](http://www.masterbrand.com/).

Within Kitchen Craft there are two lines of cabinetry called Integra and Aurora. The products are manufactured in Canada and feature recycled materials and hardwoods from certified sustainable foresters. 



## Construction Quality



Kitchen Craft cabinets are much cheaper than brands such as [KraftMaid](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/kraftmaid-cabinets/). The company offers every type of construction. One of these types is known as Frameless Construction. This style uses a thicker box construction, full overlay doors, and adjustable shelves.

Kitchen Craft uses several types of materials in their construction. These include; particle board, plywood, veneer, and Therma-Foil. The Thermafoil compound is only used on cabinet doors.

On feature that sets Kitchen Craft apart from other cabinet builders is the fully customizable cabinet interiors. So if you love bulk shopping or love roll trays for organization, Kitchen Craft provides you with customized storage solutions. 

The standard cabinet features 6-way adjustable hinges, 5/8‚Äù thick furniture board cabinet sides, and melamine interiors. The standard cabinet features a thick horizontal crosspiece brace for stabilization. The shelves are fully adjustable. Customers can also choose to upgrade to a plywood construction for increased durability. 

Cabinet drawers come in melamine, metal, or wood options. The hardwood drawers use solid hardwood, dovetailed joints, and soft-closing drawer guides. The metal drawers also feature the soft close feature. 

Cabinet interiors can be customized to white, natural wood grain, or even a combination. If you prefer, the interior can be stained to match the exterior. 

The doors of their cabinets use furniture-grade solid wood and veneers. The company also offers Thermofoil, Mullion, and specialty doors. As you can see, their selection is quite extensive. 



## Common Complaints



Kitchen Kraft has a very high reputation, affordable pricing, and wonderful selection of products. 

Some customers find that it is very difficult to contact the company directly regarding product problems or concerns. They are always redirected to their local dealers who do not always have the solution. 

When it comes down to the bottom line, the quality of the cabinets will depend on the construction style, quality of the installation, and usage. 

Be prepared for some delays in shipping and give yourself a buffer in case you need to return a damaged product. 



## Conclusion

While the majority of customers have positive experiences and are pleased with their purchases, there are several who have had problems with the finish or installation.

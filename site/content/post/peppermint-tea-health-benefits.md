## Health Benefits



Peppermint tea is amazing with stomach problems. It works almost as well as medication for problems such as colon spasms, gas, and abdominal pain. It helps to empty your stomach and helps those with gastrointestinal disorders. 

For those with upset stomach and indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, drinking peppermint tea has tangible results. Studies have shown that peppermint tea helped relieve the symptoms in 67% of patients. 

Its also very effective in minimizing morning sickness, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, gas, and diarrhea.

Many of these symptoms; heartburn, morning sickness, etc were  prominent during my pregnancies and I have found peppermint tea to bring relief, and I did not have to worry about caffeine content as it is naturally caffeine free. 

I have also found that a lightly brewed peppermint tea can work wonders on an infant suffering from gas pain. My first baby was very colicky for this reason. Very lightly brewed tea helped remove the troublesome pain and helped her stomach feel much better.  

Peppermint tea is also quite useful in clearing the respiratory tract when ill with a cold and helping to inhibit the herpes simplex virus type 1. 



## Nutrients



Very cool and refreshing, peppermint tea is very pleasant to drink. It is very light yellow in color when brewed and contains traces of vitamin B1, B2, B3, B6, Folate, Pantothenic acid, and vitamin C. You will also find plenty of retinoids and carotenoids. The tea also contains minerals such as calcium, copper, Iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc. 

Peppermint tea is caffeine free and is considered very safe for all adults, and in small quantities for children under 8 years of age. As with all herbs, moderation is advised. 



## Origin



Peppermint comes from the mint plant of which there are many varieties. Peppermint, however, is a cross between the water mint and the spear mint. The plant, also known as  M. balsamea Willd, originated in the Middle East and Europe. Some believe that it originated in Northern Africa and the Mediterranean region. 

Today it is cultivated all over the world. It is estimated that half of the world's peppermint commercially grown comes from the United States. Specialists, however, vouch that the best peppermint is grown either on English soil or French. 

This may have to do with the variety of peppermint grown. The United States generally grows black peppermint, while European nations tend to focus more on the white variety. 



## Where to Buy



Peppermint is sold in all mainstream grocery stores in quantities of 0.85 oz (24 g), 1.41oz (40g), 2.3 oz (66 g). The quantity changes depending on the brand as due the prices. Generally, 1.41 oz (40g) sells for $5. Quantities lower than 1.41 oz sell for $2 and $4. 

Mainstream grocery stores rarely carry loose leaf herbal teas, although it can be found online. Loose peppermint leaves sell in a bulk of half a pound for a price of $15.

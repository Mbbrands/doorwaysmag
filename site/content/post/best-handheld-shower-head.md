![love your shower](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/love_your_shower-300x200.jpg)Other than maybe a cup of java, there is hardly anything more refreshing in the morning than a crisp shower. 

I know I love waking my mind and body up as a gentle spray of water from a handheld showerhead cascades over me. 

However, you do not need to wait until the morning to enjoy a great shower; taking a shower any time of the day or night can be an invigorating experience when you have a handheld showerhead at your disposal.

Besides having the benefit of being invigorating to use, the cost of this type of bathroom showerhead is fairly nominal. 

Plus, it offers a wealth of advantages that are hard to find in other types of showerheads. A handheld showerhead is easy to operate and allows people to take a shower in comfort without having to conform to the height of a traditional wall-mounted showerhead. 

This style of showerhead is also ideal for using to bathe children or even pets. When the mobility of the showerhead is no longer needed, simply attach it back to the wall-mounted holder and you have a typical showerhead once more.

Handheld showerheads come with a flexible hose tubing and are typically mounted to a vertical bar that serves as a resting place for the showerhead. The hose section of the showerhead comes in varying lengths, so it is a good idea to check the hose length and match it to the space where it will be used. 

If you have a shower with no tub, a 60-inch hose length or smaller is probably adequate; however, if you have a large bathing area, you may find that a hose that is 72 to 84-inches in length is a better choice, especially if you plan on using the showerhead to rinse the tub.

The showerhead itself comes in a variety of attractive finishes and typically includes multiple spray settings so you can get that perfect [spa-like experience](http://spas.about.com/od/choosingaspa/a/goodspa.htm).

Handheld showerheads come in many different styles and finishes. There are models with single or dual heads, ones that have special anti-clog or self-cleaning features, and even models that have LED lights that change the appearance of the water color according to the temperature setting. 

A large number of handheld showerheads include [water conservation](http://www.epa.gov/greenhomes/ConserveWater.htm) features that meet or exceed city or state water usage ordinances and yet do not reduce the water pressure.

## Installation Tips



Changing out a standard showerhead for a handheld showerhead is a relatively easy process and often requires no more than the use of one or two standard household tools, if any at all. 

Due to the manufacturers of the use of universal components, showerheads are highly interchangeable and only require a minimal amount of time and effort to install.

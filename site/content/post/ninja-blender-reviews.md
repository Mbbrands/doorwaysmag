[A Ninja Blender is the answer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00939FV8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00939FV8K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=UM5YUFPH53TJYBZU). 

On my quest to find the ultimate blender for my kitchen, the Ninja offered all the benefits of an ultra-premium blender without the price tag.

Before I decided to pull the trigger and give the Ninja a shot, I read many blender reviews online. Like you, I wanted to make sure I didn't waste my money on another blender that didn't live up to it's advertising.

Below you'll discover why the [Ninja Professional Blender is a great alternative](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00939FV8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00939FV8K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=UM5YUFPH53TJYBZU) to more expensive options like Blendtec or Vitamix and a big leap above other inexpensive options. Plus, you'll get access to my other Ninja Blender reviews.



## Why You'll Love the Ninja Professional Blender



[![ninja professional blender reviews](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ninja_professional_blender_reviews-300x300.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00939FV8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00939FV8K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=UM5YUFPH53TJYBZU)If you've seen the infomercials (they always suck me in) you'll know that the Ninja Blender has a ton of power. It can blend anything in seconds. In fact, the most inexpensive version (NJ600) has an amazing 1000 watts of blending power. 

If you still want more, the next step up offers 1100 watts. Considering the price, you get about the same amount of power as the Vitamix which weighs in with only 1380 watts.

When I was originally researching blender options, I was only looking at the base model because I wanted to get the best value for my money. However, after reading other reviews on Amazon, I was convinced that I needed the model that [included two Nutri Ninja single serve cups.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00939FV8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00939FV8K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=UM5YUFPH53TJYBZU)

These cups allow you conveniently blend your smoothie into a cup, reducing your mess and cleanup. Many reviews also mentioned that the compact space in the cup, as opposed to the large blender jar, gives you a more consistent blend. They are also a great way to grind spices or puree small amounts of vegetables.

One look at the Ninja blender blades and you'll notice why it delivers such a power punch. Instead of blades on the bottom of the blender, they are positioned throughout the middle of the jar. For this reason it has a sophisticated locking lid and release function. You can't turn on the blender unless the lid is securely locked on. 

If you like making multiple smoothies in the morning or want to make large quantities of pureed vegetables, you'll love the extra large, 72 oz. container. It is durable and dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. I should note that the container is not made of glass but actually BPA-free plastic. 

The Ninja Professional has four basic settings to help you chop up or puree anything your heart desires. It has a pulse setting and three speeds. What can you do with a Ninja? Almost anything!





  * Crush Ice


  * Puree


  * Blend


  * Chop


  * Dice



I realize that buying an expensive blender is a tough decision. Many of my readers have told me that the read dozens of reviews before emailing me for more advice. I'm going to tell you the same thing I tell them.

If you've been reading reviews and watching videos online, you should take to heart that you're not the only one. However, don't waste more time reading more reviews. It's time to make your decision. 

As you know already, the Ninja Professional Blender is not a Vitamix or a Blendtec blender. However, it is an exceptional blender available at an attractive price. If you're looking at the base model like I was, I would encourage you to look at the [1100 watt version that comes with two single serve cups as well.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00939FV8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00939FV8K&linkCode=as2&tag=neighborhoodenvy-20&linkId=UM5YUFPH53TJYBZU)

After you get your Ninja blender, feel free to shoot me an email and let me know what you think of it - I'd love to hear your thoughts!

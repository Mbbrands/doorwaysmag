They take the time to create lovely and unique door overlays including square, raised, arched, slab, and recessed panel options. The wide selection of finishes is also a popular feature of KraftMaid Cabinets. 



To find these cabinets for purchase stop by your local Lowes or Home Depot. KraftMaid cabinets are also sold by authorized dealers, so be sure to check the KraftMaid website for a location near you. 



<h2>Company Background</h2>



KraftMaid Cabinets is stationed in Ohio and has been in business for over 40 years. The company started out as a small local carpentry shop and has since grown into one of the largest built-to order cabinets manufacturers in the US.



They offer over 70 finish options, 100 door styles, 200+ storage solutions and 800+decorative enhancements. After completing an order, KraftMaid even has a certified professional inspect your order before sending it off to you. 



<h2>Construction Quality</h2>



The standard wall cabinets have adjustable shelves so that you utilize them fully. The cabinet doors feature hidden 6-way adjustable Whisper Touch Hinges that enable the doors to close silently.



The full-depth shelves are 3/4” thick and are lined with a natural birch wood laminate. An All-Plywood Construction Upgrade is available for those who desire increased quality and durability. 



Face Frames are rounded to protect you from scratches as well as to imitate the appearance of fine furniture. The interior of these cabinets features birch laminate. However, this can be upgraded to match the exterior if you order an ALL Plywood Construction. 



There are five different types of wood offered by KraftMaid Cabinetry. These are Alder, Maple, Oak, Birch, Hickory, and Cherry. 



<h2>Common Complaints</h2>



While the company boasts of quality, many customers have their doubts. The majority of customers had complaints regarding:



<ul>

<li>Incorrect shipments</li>

<li>Poor sustomer service</li>

<li>Parts arriving damaged/flawed</li>

<li>Inconsistencies in the finish</li>

</ul>



Another customer noted that blue painters tape took the finish off his cabinets, so this is also something to be aware of. In regards to the shipping and handling problems, one should plan in advance for delays and possible damage from shipment. Being prepared will help minimize the frustration of unmet expectations. 



KraftMaid also explains on their website that natural wood is prone to hairline cracks at the joints and that these do not weaken the strength of the joints. Reading through KraftMaid’s Natural Wood Expectations is a must. 



There they explain the differences in finishes and suggest ordering a sample to view in your home as the lighting in a showroom may be different. 



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



These semi-custom cabinets are lovely to look at can add warmth and beauty to any kitchen. Like any remodel, researching and understanding both the product and your budget is a must. KraftMaid cabinets are priced higher than most, but they also offer two forms of construction, a cheaper version, and an ALL PLYWOOD Version. 



With their lovely finishes and multiple door styles KraftMaid Can recreate your kitchen space into something pleasing.

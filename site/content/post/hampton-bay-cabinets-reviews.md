**Do you have experience with Hampton Bay cabinetry? Leave your review below.**



Hampton Bay provides beautiful cabinets at an affordable price without sacrificing quality or style.  

Many of our readers said they love that the cabinets come in different varieties and with plenty of finish options. Hampton Bay cabinets can be purchased at [your local Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/c/SPC_BRD_KI_HBCabinets). 



### Construction Quality



Hampton Bay has been in business for over 25 years and is known for delivering essentials that will complement any decor style you desire. The products are manufactured in Florida as well as Asia.

Hampton Bay Cabinets use many of the same construction features found in high-end cabinets. The face frames are assembled from pocket screwed joints. Drawers feature four hardwood sides.

A full back panel is standard on all of their wall and base cabinets. This adds additional strength and makes installation easy.

White cabinet interiors are standard with Thermo-foil doors while natural maple interiors are available with maple and oak doors. 

If you desire soft closing and full extension drawers, you will need to chose the upgrade option as these features are not standard. This can add additional expense to your budget.

The shelves are fully adjustable allowing you to customize them to fit your belongings precisely. The standard cabinet drawers feature heavy steel sides and 5/8‚Äù thick bottoms. Dovetail drawer boxes with the soft close feature also require an upgrade.

**Hampton Bay offers several glass options including:**




  * Clear


  * Ribbed


  * Cross Reeded


  * Frosted



Decorative end panels and molding add beauty and charm while rollout shelves provide convenience and functionality. You can even choose to install a wine rack to store your wines elegantly.



### Common Complaints



When it comes to the quality of the material, the shredded MDF particles can come apart if the product was handled roughly during transport and due to the use of staples. Some customers have also noted that the veneer bubbles when exposed to moisture. 

Take care to keep your cabinets dry and minimize their exposure to moisture as much as possible. This can also depend on the construction style chosen.

Some customers also disliked the limited available sizes, but the Hampton Bay products have a large selection of hardware. 



### Conclusion



For affordable cabinets that are decent in quality, arrive quickly, and provide a pleasant array of color options and styles, Hampton Bay is a good fit. The Hampton Bay cabinets are a popular choice at the Home Depot for their quick installation and pleasant appearance.

Hampton Bay offers an excellent variety of door styles and finishes to accommodate a wide array of styles and tastes, allowing you to customize your kitchen for an affordable price. 

Home Depot can provide you with comprehensive information and even provides a free in store appointment with a designer to help you find the best pick for your home.

## Uses



Vanilla essential oil is in food flavoring, aromatherapy, and topical applications. While there aren’t any side effects from using vanilla oil, it is recommended to do a skin test to ensure there is not a individual allergic reaction. 



## Origin



Vanilla oil comes from Vanilla planifolia, which is a species of the Orchidaceae family. Vanilla originates from Central America and Mexico but can also be found in Asia, Northern Europe, and Canada. Today, Madagascar is the largest vanilla producer in the world. 

Vanilla has large creeper vines with clusters of fragrant yellow/green flowers. As they ripen, these turn into vanilla pods. It is these pods that are used to create the essential oil.



## Extraction



Vanilla essential oil is extracted from a resinous substance taken from fermented vanilla beans. Unlike other essential oils, vanilla oil can not be extracted through the process of steam distillation. Instead it has its own three types of extraction methods. The first is vanilla carbon dioxide (CO2).

In this method, vanilla pods are sealed inside a stainless steel chamber along with CO2 gas. Then the contents are pressurized. The CO2 becomes a supercritical fluid that pulls the oil out of the vanilla bean pods. Once this occurs the pressure is release and the Co2 returns back to its gaseous state leaving behind the oil. 

The second method is known as Vanilla absolute. This method is used to create perfumery products. It is extracted by selective solvent extraction. It uses non-polar solvents followed by polar solvents. The final method of extraction is known as vanilla oleoresin. This method creates a resinoid drawn from the vanilla pods. 



## Varieties



There are several varieties on the market. These varieties are classified by where the vanilla was grown and the type of extraction method used. 

**Examples include:**





  * Bourbon vanilla from Madagascar


  * Mexican vanilla from Mexico


  * Tahitian vanilla from  French Polynesia





## Where to Buy



Vanilla essential oil can be purchased from Now Living, Nature’s Fusions, and Eden’s Gardens. The typical quantity size appears to be 10 ml which sells for an average price of $6.

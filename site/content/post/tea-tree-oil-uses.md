Australian tea tree oil or more commonly the tea tree essential oil is a gold mine of general remedy solutions. 

Native east coast Australians have been reaping the benefits of this oil since centuries but it was brought to the international market by explorers in the late 18th century. 

Tea tree oil which is scientifically known as [Melaleuca Alternifonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca_alternifolia), naturally contains the two most powerful antimicrobial and antiseptic compounds – Terpinen-4-ol and Eucalyptol. The huge range of medicinal properties offered by this oil like being antiseptic, stimulant, antifungal, balsamic, etc. make it the most popular of all the natural essential oils.

## Origin



The tree from which this oil is extracted is exclusively found in Australia, especially on the east coast. The natives of the region have been using its medicinal properties since generations by simply crushing and applying the leaves on wounds. 

As opposed to the common belief, the tea tree oil is neither extracted from the seeds nor the tea tree itself, but it is obtained by processing the leaves and twigs by modern steam distillation techniques. 

The tea tree essential oil was brought to the international market in the latter half of the 18th century after Lieutenant James Cook discovered its medicinal properties to treat his men from scurvy.

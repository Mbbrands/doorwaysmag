A pizza stone is a fabulous cooking tool that allows you not only to make a crispy pizza, and also allows you to make other foods crispy too. 

The best pizza stones absorb moisture as the pizza cooks, which results in making the crust crispy. They come in many shapes and sizes and can be made from a variety of materials as well.

## How Do Pizza Stones Work?



Besides cooking pizza, pizza stones are also ideal for cooking breads, french fries, fish sticks, and many other frozen foods. 

It is not necessary to turn foods while baking them on a pizza stone as the porous nature of the pizza stone material absorbs ice crystals. 

Pizza stones also are able to help the oven hold and spread heat [more efficiently and evenly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_stone).

Pizza stones can be made from a variety of materials that include cast iron, stone, and sometimes even steal. Choosing the right type of stone largely depends on your own personal preferences and how you like to cook. 

Clay and stone materials absorb moisture while the pizza is baking and must be heated in the oven for approximately 30 minutes before using. 

Cast iron varieties heat quickly and are typically easier to clean than stone models. Cast iron stones may also come with handles to make it easier to use. 

Steel pizza stones are able to cook pizza more evenly and more quickly than stones, however they are also typically heavier and do not come with handles. 

Here are some examples of popular pizza stones that also come with high satisfaction ratings:

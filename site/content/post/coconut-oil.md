Coconut oil has over 100 uses. It is so popular that it is often classified as a [superfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood). Its uses, however, extend far beyond the kitchen. Its unique combination of fatty acids has many positive effects on all health aspects from skincare to blood cholesterol levels.

## Benefits of Coconut Oil



The benefits of coconut oil are [very extensive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil) and are powerful both internally externally, and emotionally. 

It is known to help [maintain cholesterol levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20523108), decrease huger and boost weight loss, increase the strength of your immune system as we as regulate your metabolism. In addition, it is known to improve dental strength and offer relief from high blood pressure. 

While the internal benefits of coconut oil are beneficial, the external uses are just as potent. The auric acid, capri acid and caprylic acid found in coconut oil act as a very powerful antimicrobial, anti-fungal, and antibacterial oil. The oil is also known for its antioxidant and soothing qualities. 



## Coconut Oil Uses



Many use it as a hair product straight from the jar. Rubbing oil on the scalp and hair provides deep moisturization for damaged locks as well as relief and treatment of dandruff, itching, and works as a lice deterrent. Regular use restores the shine to dull hair and even helps regrow damaged hair thicker and healthier. 

Others use it as a skin care product. It is completely safe and has a myriad of beneficial effects on skin. Its antimicrobial and antibacterial properties make it a favorite among those who suffer from skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis, dermatitis, and eczema to name a few. 

As someone who suffered from acne, I can attest that coconut oil does have a soothing affect and helps the skin to heal. Acne medications also tend to dry the skin out. Rather than apply pore clogging moisturizer, coconut oil offers a pleasant and 100% natural alternative. 

Its healing properties have long been noted by the [medical community](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/coconut-oil). Studies have shown that when coconut oil is applied to infected areas it creates a barrier and protects that infected area from further dust, bacteria, and viruses. When put on bruises, the healing process is known to be faster. 

My favorite use of coconut oil is as a diaper rash cream. Diaper rash is often caused by irritation as well as yeast infections. As a mother of young children, I have found hat coconut oil soothes the redness, creates a barrier against waste, and heals the irritated skin. 

I have never had a diaper rash last past two days with frequent applications of coconut oil. It is safe and healthier than chemical products and baby powder.

It is typically used as a liquid for topical purposes. Unlike other oils, coconut oil remains a solid at room temperature and only melts at temperatures higher than 78 degrees Fahrenheit. As such one need only heat it slightly for it turn into a liquid. 

For internal use, it can be consumed both in liquid or solid state depending on personal preference or recipe instructions. 



## Origin



Coconut oil originates from the countries of Africa, Asia, and the Polynesia. It comes in in six varieties. These include pure coconut oil, refined, organic, virgin, organic virgin, and extra virgin coconut oil. All of these are derived from the same source, coconut trees, but their method of extraction and processing differs. 



## Extraction



Coconut oil is often extracted through the use of cold pressing. The second method of extraction is boiling the milk of the coconut. Boiling however destroys many of the beneficial properties and is often avoided. 

Coconut oil is often cold pressed through machine pressing. This is done by either electrically or engine driven oil mil. Sometimes the oil is obtained through manual pressing.



## Varieties



Pure coconut oil is extracted from dried coconut kernels, known as copra. This type of oil has no additives and extracted by compression.  This particular variety is favored for purposes such as eating, massage oil, as well as hair and cosmetic purposes. 

Refined Coconut oil, also known as RBD coconut oil, is refined, bleached, and deodorized. This process creates a thin, colorless, and odorless oil. 
 
The fourth variety is virgin coconut oil. This oil is extracted from the milk of the coconut meat through the use of fermentation, centrifugal separation, as well as enzyme action. This process yields an oil that is very high in antioxidants. The anti-microbial property is also much more effective in this variety. 

The fifth type, organic coconut oil, is derived from the coconuts of organically grown coconut palms. These palm trees are grown without the use of synthetic fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides. This type of oil is very prominent in organic cosmetic products such as organic skin creams, snacks, and soaps. 

Organic Virgin coconut oil is the same as virgin with the difference being the organic nature of the coconut trees themselves. This type is often considered to be the purest form of coconut oil and is the rarest of the six varieties. 

Extra Virgin coconut oil is the most highly contested variety as there are no set standards for determining the virginity grade of the oil.   



## Where to Buy



Coconut oil is readily available in most supermarkets and whole food stores. It comes in all quantities from 16 oz, 32 oz, 54 oz, and all the way up to an entire bucket of it. 

Popular brands include Nature’s Way, Nutiva, CocoCare, and Carrington Farms. The average price for a 32 oz container ranges between $9.99 up to $25 depending on the brand as well as the grade of the coconut oil.

## Benefits of Lemon Essential Oil



Lemon oil has the power to eliminate dandruff, strengthen hair, and brighten the skin. From my personal experience, lemon oil is very effective in treating pimples and reducing the scaring often associated with frequent breakouts.

As a young teenager, I suffered from continuous and severe acne. Using lemon oil and the juice of lemons I found that it rejuvenated my skin, brightened the dull irritated skin and minimized the amount of oil my skin produced. 

By reducing the amount of oil produced by my skin, my acne breakouts diminished in severity and frequency, while the antiseptic properties of lemon oil continued to treat the existing pimples.

Another benefit of Lemon Oil is its high vitamin and antioxidant content. Frequent use helps stimulate the bodies white blood cells, thereby increasing your ability to fight off infections and disease. It also improves the circulation and boosts the body’s overall immune system. 

A third benefit is its uses as a weight loss aide. Mixed with water, Lemon helps satisfy the appetite, reducing the chance of overeating. Lemon water also helps detoxify the body as well as deliver powerful antioxidants.



## Lemon Oil Uses



Lemon oil is typically used both topically and externally, as well as in perfumes and cosmetics. The refreshing scent makes it a popular choice for potpourris and scented candles. 

Since it blends well with lavender oil, sandalwood, and tea tree essential oil it is a popular ingredient in aromatherapy treatment.

While lemon oil is very safe to use it can increase [phototoxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototoxicity). In other words, applying lemon oil to the skin before laying in direct sunlight/tanning can increase the severity and chances of a sunburn.



## Origin



This particular oil is derived from the popular lemon citrus fruit. While it the original origin of lemons is unknown, India has the largest production followed by Mexico and Argentina. Lemons grow well in many other countries including the United Staes, Brazil, Italy, and People’s Republic of China. 

Lemon essential oil is extracted through the process of cold pressing. This method involves using a combination of centrifugal force, pressing, and puncturing of the rind to release the essential oil. It can also be extracted through the process of distillation. While the end result is similar, distilled lemon oil is considered to be non-phototoxic and inferior in aroma. 

There are varieties on the market that feature a similar lemon aroma. These varieties are Lemongrass and Lemon Myrtle essential oils. 



## Where to Buy



Lemon oil is very abundant and easy to purchase. It is frequently sold in quantities of 10 and 15ml, though smaller quantities are also available. 

Popular companies include Young Living, Eden’s Garden, and doTERRA. The average price of a 15 ml bottle of Lemon essential oil ranges between $5-$15.

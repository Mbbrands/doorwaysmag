Kombucha tea is quite different from regular teas. It is actually a fermented drink that is made using black tea, sugar, bacteria, and yeast. The bacteria is added to the tea and sugar and then allowed to ferment. This results in a beverage that contains vinegar and B vitamins. 

It’s quite popular for its health benefits such as preventing cancer, arthritis, and other diseases. 



## Benefits of Drinking Kombucha Tea



The ancient Chinese called this drink the “Immortal Health Elixir” do to its several health benefits. It has only recently gained popularity here in the West. It is believed that Kombucha helps detoxify the body lending to a healthy liver. It is filled with many enzymes and healthy bacteria that eases the burden on the liver.

This probiotic beverage is also high in Glucaric acid. Several studies have shown this acid to be effective in fighting and preventing pancreatic and breast cancer. This tea also contains glucosamines., which help ward of and alleviate the pain of arthritis. 

This is because glucosamines stimulate synovial hyaluronic acid production. This acid in turn protects cartilage and prevents the pain associated with arthritis.  Increased levels of hyaluronic acid helps lubricate your joints and reduce free radical damage. In a sentence, Kombucha combines all the benefits of black tea with an additional powerful blend of probiotics. 



## Nutrients



Kombachu has an amber tone and a sweet and sour fizzy taste. It contains minerals such as zinc, copper, iron, nickel, manganese, and potassium. Kombucha also contains antioxidants such as polyphenols as well as amino acids, vitamins B2, B6, and C. The beverage does contain caffeine, roughly 24 mg per 8 oz cup. 

This tea is considered unsafe by some as it has the potential to upset your stomach, and cause nausea, vomiting, and allergic reactions if it is not prepared properly. As such, it is advised that that it be avoided by pregnant women, and children.  Those who struggle with alcoholism may also want to reconsider this beverage as it does contain small amounts of alcohol.



## Origin



Kombucha is thought to have originated in China, from which it spread throughout Asia and Russia. It is only in the last two decades that it has become popular in the United States. It is derived from black tea which is then fermented with sugar, yeast, and bacteria.  

Coming from a Russian background, Kombucha was common in our household. I remember watching with fascination as my mother would pull out the SCOBY to start a new batch of Kombucha. A SCOBY is basically the home in which the bacteria reside while the beverage is fermenting. 

There are actually many different types of varieties on the market that use different types of teas as well as different blends. For example you can purchase Organic Raw Kombucha, or Kombucha created with White tea, or mixed with other fruits and flavors. 
 


## Where to Buy



It can be purchased in local grocery stores bottled around $37 for a pack of 24 (8.4 fl oz) bottles.

The average quantity ranges between 8.4 fl oz bottles up to 14 fl. oz bottles. 

You can also purchase Kombucha as a SCOBY, or Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. You can then use this purchased SCOBY to create your own Kombachu. The price for a SCOBY varies between $5 up to $25 depending on the brew used and the size of the SCOBY itself.

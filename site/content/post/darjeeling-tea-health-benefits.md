![darjeeling tea health benefits](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/darjeeling_tea_health_benefits-300x200.jpg)Darjeeling. The name alone conjures images of India and a complex blend of contradictions.

While the tea is considered a black tea, it has a distinctly unique flavor and is less oxidized than the typical black tea. Darjeeling tea is also much lighter in color and also less astringent.

It is a fascinating blend of flavor between black and green tea, in a category all of its own when it comes to taste.



## Health Benefits



Drinking Darjeeling tea is very beneficial for your cardiovascular health. According to studies, drinking five cups of tea a day helps to lower blood cholesterol as well as widen arteries.

Darjeeling tea, like other black teas assists in building bone density. Those who consistently drink a form of black tea are known to have 3% higher bone density and tend to lose the bone density at a slower rate than those who do not drink tea.

The antioxidants provided within the tea do a wonderful job in eliminating the free radicals and their potential to do long term harm to your body.



### Darjeeling Tea Nutrients



Nicknamed the “champagne of teas” and similar in color, this tea features delicate vegetal tones as well as a slightly citrusy/fruity flavor. The taste of Darjeeling tea greatly depends on when and how the tea was harvested. Tea leaves harvested during the first harvest, known as the first flush, feature a more delicate and light flavor, while the consecutive flushes feature more robust flavors.

The second flush features almost wine like flavor, which lends to the tea’s nickname. The first flush, however, is the most valued as it provides a smooth minty mountain air flavor.

Contained in this tea are powerful antioxidants called theaflavins and thearubigins. These antioxidants neutralize harmful free radicals that have to potential to wreak great havoc in the body and raise your risk of chronic diseases.

The tea also provides vitamin C, carotene, thiamine, vitamin B6, folic acid and minerals such as manganese, potassium, and trace amounts of fluoride.

The tea does contain caffeine, roughly half of what you would find in a cup of coffee, or 40-70 mg per 8 ounce up if you want to be specific.

It is considered safe with no known harmful side effects if taken in moderation. Too much caffeine can trigger increased heart rate, headache, and other symptoms of caffeine overload. Due to the caffeine, pregnant women and those breastfeeding should limit their intake. There are decaffeinated versions on the market that may be a better option in these cases.



### Origin





Darjeeling tea is grown in India, but the leaves originated in China. The tea leaves used for this delightful tea are harvested from the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which features small leaves. Today the tea is grown all throughout the Himalayan mountains.





Varieties on the market are based on the season in which the tea leaves are harvested. These seasons are known as first flush, in between, second flush, monsoon tea, and autumnal flush. Each flush lends to a different taste of Darjeeling tea.  Darjeeling tea also comes as a white tea and as oolong tea, adding even more varieties to the market.

Nonstick cookware is popular in many households because of how easy it is to use. 

Polytetrafluoroethylene, marketed under the ["Teflon" brand name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene), used to be the primary non-stick coating used on cookware; however, other types of non-stick surfaces are also becoming very popular. 

Some examples of nonstick coating include ceramic, anodized aluminum, seasoned cast iron, silicon, and enameled cast iron.

Brewed from a flowering plant within the daisy family, Chamomile tea acts as a wonderful sleep aid and has anti-irritant, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory properties making it a wonderful aid in curing a host of health problems. 



## Benefits of Chamomile Tea



One of the key ingredients in chamomile is bisabolol. When brewed, this oil has many powerful health benefits. It is very useful in calming the stomach of stomach cramps due to its antispasmodic and anti inflammatory properties. 

When I suffered from stomach problems as a child, my mother would often have me drink it twice a day on days my stomach was upset, and more often than not it did calm my stomach down. 

As a woman, I can attest firsthand that chamomile tea also minimizes the unpleasant symptoms associated with menstrual cramps. 

It is also effective for those suffering from IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The cramping, pain, and bloating that comes with this syndrome are lessened by drinking chamomile tea daily. Drinking the tea daily is also said to relieve the feeling of nausea when suffering from a stomach flu. 

Chamomile tea also works wonderfully as a sleep aid, a benefit cherished by those suffering from insomnia. Drinking the tea up to 30 minutes prior to going to bed helps battle sleeplessness. 

Not only is chamomile beneficial internally, it is just as useful externally. Wounds and burns have been known to be treated using chamomile. To use it on burns, one must brew at least 3 tea bags into one cup filled with boiling water. When the water is cooled, one can use it with a cloth to act as a compress on the affected area. 

Another skin benefit of chamomile is its lightening effect. Many place it on their face or even add it to their bath. As such it also works  as a very effective dark under eye circle removal and relieving eye fatigue. To for this benefit, one uses two steeped tea bags and places them on the eyes overnight as a compress. 



## Nutrients



Chamomile has a very sweet and the tea has a fragrant floral aroma. The taste varies on how long you will brew the tea. If you steep it for longer amounts of time it will lend to a more bitter taste. 

When brewed the color ranges from light yellow, to golden yellow and amber. It is naturally caffeine free and contains calcium, magnesium, fluoride, potassium, folate, vitamin A, and several others in trace amounts. The tea also contains health boosting flavonoids/antioxidants which are key in fighting free radicals. 

Keep in mind that all herbal teas are recommended in moderation. Due to its ability to act as a sleep aid, one should use caution when operating heavy machinery or driving. Overdose of chamomile can also cause skin reactions and vomiting in some individuals. Another caution is for those who suffer from allergies to ragweed pollen or hayfever as chamomile has the potential to trigger the allergy. 

Pregnant women must avoid drinking chamomile tea in large quantities as it is considered an abortifacient and can trigger preterm labor if taken in access. If one wants to drink a small dosage for medicinal purposes of alleviating morning sickness, it is okay. It is sometimes good to take close to the due date because it can stimulate uterine contractions.

Those taking blood thinners should also shy away from this herbal tea as it also acts a blood thinner due to the chemical called coumarin. 



## Origin



The tea itself originates from the daisy-like flowers of the Asteraceae family. It is believed to have originated in ancient Egypt, where it was used as a cure for fevers and the flowers used for cosmetic purposes. It is not a picky plant and grows all over Europe and America. 

There are two varieties on the market. Some teas use Matricaria chamomilla, also known as German chamomile or wild chamomile or the tea will use Chamaemelum nobile, also known as Roman, English, or garden chamomile. both are frequently used. 



## Where to Buy



Chamomile tea is sold in several formats. You can purchase entire dried flower heads, tea bags, or the liquid extract essential oil. Almost all mainstream grocery stores offer this in the herbal tea section as it is a very common tea. 

Tea bags are typically sold in boxed quantities of .73 oz (20 grams), 0.85 (24 grams) and 1.7 oz (47 grams) although you can easily find bigger quantities. A .73 oz box of tea bags costs around $2.31 while a 1.7 oz box between $3 and $4.

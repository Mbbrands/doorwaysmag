The bathroom fan may not be the first thing that you think about when upgrading your bathroom; however, it is a very important element that needs to be working properly and efficiently. 

Bathroom exhaust fans draw out air from the room so that new air enters and refreshes the space. 

One of the primary purposes for having an exhaust fan is to eliminate moisture from the bathroom. Reduction in humidity rates is essential when it comes to keeping a bathroom properly maintained.

## How to Calculate CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute)



When shopping for a bathroom fan you'll notice that there is a wide range of options. Not to mention, each model is designed with specific performance criteria in mind. One of these metrics is Cubic Feet per Minute or CFM. This number describes how much air the fan can move per minute. 

In order to get the best ventilation in your bathroom, you'll need a fan that can replace the entire volume of air at least 8 times per hour. 

To determine the size of fan you'll need, you should start by measuring your bathroom. First, measure the width. Next, measure the length of the room end to end. Finally, measure the distance from the floor to the ceiling. 

If your bathroom is a simple rectangle, this will be easy. However, if your floorplan is a more complex design you may need to take a few extra measurements to get an accurate estimate.

With these numbers in hand, multiply all three numbers together to find the total amount of cubic feet within your bathroom. For example, my bathroom is 8' long by 6' wide with 8' ceilings (8 x 6 x 8 = 384 cubic feet). 

**If you need help multiplying these numbers together you can use my free [square footage calculator](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/square-footage-calculator/).**

The final step is to figure out what size fan can replace the air in your bathroom 8 times per hour. We will determine this by multiplying the total cubic feet (384 in my example) by 0.13. To complete the example, this would look like 384 x 0.13 = 49 CFM. That means that I need a fan with a rating of at least 50 CFM.

What size do you need? Use the chart above to find the right size fan for your bathroom.



## Why a Bathroom Fan is a Must-Have Item



Excessive amounts of moisture in the bathroom can cause wallpaper and paint to peel and in extreme cases, doors begin to warp and no longer close properly. 

Without proper ventilation, trapped moisture can also provide a friendly breeding ground for mold to grow and reproduce at an alarming rate [which can be harmful to one's health](http://www.epa.gov/mold/preventionandcontrol.html). 

Besides being able to decrease moisture levels, these fans also help to reduce and eliminate odors as well as fumes from cleaning agents that have the potential to create health hazards if inhaled. 



## Top Rated Bathroom Fans



If you are considering installing a new bathroom fan, there are many reliable products on the market to choose from in colors that make it easy to match your existing decor. The most common styles are made from a white plastic material. 

Here are a few of the most popular models that also have great customer satisfaction ratings. 



## Panasonic FV-15VQ5 150 CFM WhisperCeiling Fan



![panasonic whisperceiling 150cfm bathroom fan](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/panasonic_whisperceiling_150cfm_bathroom_fan-150x150.jpg)This model features a fully enclosed condenser motor in addition to a double-tapered bladed blower that moves a large amount of air both quietly and efficiently. This Panasonic fan has been rated at a zero point 25 inch water gauge, which is the industry standard for performance measurement with ENERGY STAR, Leed for homes, ASHRAE, and HVI. 

Made from high-quality materials, this bathroom fan gives you trouble free operation for years to come due to features such as lubricated motors which tend to wear down out of slower pace. The condenser motor also operates at lower temperatures which increases the lifespan of both the motor and the bearings. 

The housing of the fan is comprised of a heavy duty gauge zinc galvanized steel and includes a rust protection paint. The built-in damper prevent backdraft as well as helps to eliminate outside air from blowing in through the fan. This is an exceptional model that does not take long to install.



## Broan 676 110-CFM Ceiling Mount Ventilation Fan



![broan ultra silent bath fan](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/broan_ultra_silent_bath_fan-150x150.jpg)This Broan 676 is a powerful exhaust fan that is so quiet that you hardly notice it is running. It is designed to work at peak efficiency in bathrooms areas that are up to 100 square feet in size. This model is easy to install and gives you the ability to mount it on the wall or on the ceiling. 

This bathroom fan does an exceptional job at pulling moisture up and drawing it out of the room. It has a sleek and contemporary design that looks attractive with almost any decor. 



## Hunter 83001 Riazzi Bathroom Fan



![hunter riazzi bathroom fan light](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hunter_riazzi_bathroom_fan_light-150x150.jpg)The Riazzi bathroom exhaust fan provides excellent air movement so it is very efficient at whisking away unwanted moisture before problems have a chance to occur. This model has an elegant cased glass and architectural cast bead design. 

The included light is ideal for times when extra light is needed and the fan motor runs so quietly that it is barely perceptible.

Although there are many luxury bathroom fans available, the decision to own one should not be based in its aesthetic value alone. 

Bathroom fans help to eliminate moisture in the bathroom which in turn helps prevent window fogging, paint peeling, and mold buildup. They also remove unwanted odors and fumes for a healthier environment. 

Bathroom fans are affordable, easy to install, and can be decorative as well.

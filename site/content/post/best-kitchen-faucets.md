An easy way to change the look of your kitchen is with a new sink faucet. In fact, it's an inexpensive upgrade that may even outlast the rest of your kitchen decor!

As an architectural consultant, I enjoy helping my clients design and build their dream kitchens. Sometimes this means I help them draw plans and hire contractors. Other times, I just point them to the right tools and they tackle the project themselves.

My hourly consultations are usually filled with valuable information on the best materials, appliances and fixtures to put in a kitchen. After a while I realized I had a wealth of knowledge about the best kitchen faucets. 

**Below are the top picks I give to my clients, and now I'm sharing them with you for free.**

## Top Pick: Delta Leland Pull-Down Kitchen Faucet



[easyazon_link identifier="B0040YXMRA" locale="US" tag="doorways-20"]![delta leland pull down kitchen faucet](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/delta_leland_pull_down_kitchen_faucet-300x300.jpg)[/easyazon_link]Delta, known for making top-of-the-line kitchen fixtures, has delivered again with their Leland Series kitchen faucet. 

**When I help my clients find the right faucet for their kitchen, we are looking for three specific features. These include style, function and price.** 

_Now you can use my same criteria to find the perfect faucet for your kitchen, too._



## Style



The [easyazon_link identifier="B0040YXMRA" locale="US" tag="doorways-20"]Delta Leland series faucet[/easyazon_link] comes in 5 distinct styles to compliment almost any decor. When shopping online you can select from chrome, arctic stainless, stainless, venetian bronze and champagne bronze finishes.

This single handle faucet was inspired by the teapot design. The pear shaped base and pull-down faucet give this fixture a luxurious look and feel. Unlike other discount fixtures, Delta delivers quality materials and great design at a [easyazon_link identifier="B0040YXMRA" locale="US" tag="doorways-20"]great price[/easyazon_link] (more on that later).



## Function



The Leland faucet includes a pull-down spray wand with a 20-inch reach, thanks to the 59-inch hose included. The spout also swivels 360-degrees, so you can make the most of your sink real estate. No more hard to reach spots!

One problem I've faced in the past is purchasing a faucet that did not have a high enough arc to get large pots underneath. This faucet is 14 â…ž" tall to help give you maximum sink space to wash all but the largest pots and pans. 

Just from the photo you call tell that this faucet will work great in one-hole sinks, but what if you have a three-hole design? The good news is that it comes with an optional "escutcheon plate" - a flat piece of decorative metal designed to cover up the additional holes. 



## Price



One of the most common obstacles I face as a kitchen designer is getting my clients to set aside enough of their budget for fixtures. Unfortunately, when all of their money has been spent on cabinets and countertops, the last thing they want to do is spend hundreds on fixtures. 

The good news is that the Delta Leland series is [easyazon_link identifier="B0040YXMRA" locale="US" tag="doorways-20"]both affordable and stylish[/easyazon_link].

Since I look at hundreds of kitchen faucets on a regular basis at showrooms and in catalogues, I can tell you that this faucet is a bargain. If you want high-quality but don't want to pay and arm and a leg for nice fixtures, you can't go wrong with Delta.

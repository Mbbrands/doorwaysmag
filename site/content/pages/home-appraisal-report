<strong>Attention Home Buyers: Do you know what your dream home is REALLY worth?</strong>

It might be worth tens of thousands of dollars less than you think

That's a good thing, right?

<strong>Wrong. Let me tell you why...</strong>

Now that the real estate market is booming again and prices are rising all over the country...

Home buyers and sellers are running into one major problem:

<strong>Low appraisals</strong>

Unfortunately, if an appraisal comes in lower than expected it will kill a home sale instantly.

<h2>Your Dream Home Could Disappear Right Before Your Eyes</h2>

Let's imagine you finally found your dream home in a <strong>great neighborhood with award winning schools</strong>. 

Next, you offer the home seller a few thousand dollars above asking price because you <strong>have to HAVE this home</strong> and the offer is still well within your budget.

Next, an appraiser will be hired to estimate the value of the property in relation to comparable homes (comps) in your area.

If the appraiser returns with a value that is lower than your offer, the seller will rarely want to reduce their asking price to make this deal. 

After all, no one wants to see their hard-earned equity flushed down the drain especially when <strong>home prices are rising all around them</strong>.

And unfortunately for you, <strong>your lender won't give you any extra money</strong> to make this deal above the appraisal value.

So what will the seller do instead?

They'll leave the home on the market until another buyer comes along - maybe just hours later - <strong>with an appraiser who is more easily influenced</strong>.

And if you're the buyer you could lose your dream home and be left to start your home search all over again.

In this article I'm going to show you what appraisers look for so you can point them in the right direction - i.e. towards your offer price. 

I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep this report online so read carefully and take notes.

<h2>Why Your Bank Won't Let You Spend Your Own Money</h2>

Unfortunately low appraisals are a problem many home buyers are facing in our current economy…

You'd think we should be able to buy and sell things <strong>at whatever price we want</strong>… 

After all we live in a free market - God Bless the USA

<strong>Using our money however we want is part of our natural freedoms, right?</strong>

Unfortunately, banks don't think so.

You see, a bank won't lend you money to buy a house that is worth less than the loan amount. 

That's because if one day you can't pay your mortgage and foreclose, the bank is going to need to reclaim ALL of their cash by selling your house. 

And they can't do that if they are unable to sell the house for what you bought it for.

By the way, <strong>banks hate losing money.</strong>

However, this wasn't a problem just a few years ago....

<h2>Did Appraisers Cause The Housing Bubble?</h2>

During the housing bubble banks were trying to underwrite mortgages as fast as they possibly could. 

So, they'd hire a local appraiser they trusted and tell him to come back with a favorable appraisal.

If they did a good job, the appraiser was guaranteed to keep getting work for as long as they could imagine... 

….that is until the bubble burst.

Well, as they say, hindsight is 20/20. 

After the bubble burst, the government took a close look at this appraisal process...

...and realized that it's not very ethical to let banks control home values.

So, they put together a document called the Home Valuation Code of Conduct - aka the HVCC

This code of conduct specifically stated that banks were required to hire an impartial third party to complete the appraisal from now on.

These third parties are called Appraisal Management Companies (AMC)

They hire the cheapest and least experienced appraisers at rock bottom prices... 

...turn around and charge the bank a premium for their services...

....and then keep the difference.

Typically these outsourced appraisers are unfamiliar with the neighborhoods they visit. 

Since these appraisers are farmed out all over the states they work in, they rarely see the same neighborhood more than once.

That means they don't know the <strong>little details about your market that you know know all about</strong>.

So, what happens?

They pick out comparable homes - "comps" - that are of lower quality and ultimately brings down the value of the home you plan to buy.

<h2>How to Know Exactly What Your Appraiser is Thinking</h2>

To make sure your appraiser does his job right and doesn't blow the sale for you - you'll need to do some homework. 

You'll need to know exactly what he's looking for. 

That's why I created the <strong>Home Appraisal Report</strong>, a step-by-step checklist that will show you exactly what an appraiser includes in his report to the bank.

This way you can fill it out ahead of time and give your appraiser a few favorable comps that he might of missed.

<strong>After all, the HVCC doesn't say anything about not letting the buyer interact with the appraiser - it just says that the bank can't.</strong>

If the appraiser misses the mark and you lose your dream home it's not their fault - they don't know what homes are worth in your neighborhood. 

The blame will be placed squarely on your shoulders.

But, I don't want that to happen to you like it has for countless unprepared home buyers.

After you download the <strong>Home Appraisal Report</strong> you'll be able to accurately estimate what your dream home is worth.

Plus, you have direct access to the exact items your appraiser is looking for. <strong>It will be like you're reading his mind.</strong>

<h2>My 26-point Comps Table: Your Secret to Success</h2>

Inside the report you'll get a <strong>printable 26-point Comps Table</strong> that will let you easily compare homes in your neighborhood side by side.

With this table you'll be able to compare the features of each home and make simple adjustments to estimate the value of your dream home.

For example, if a comparable home down the street recently sold for less than your offer price… 

….but was in poor condition and badly in need of repair you can make adjustments for this.

This should increase your home value and you'll need to make adjustments for this.

There are also 3 pages in the checklist dedicated to recording any improvements that have been made to the home...

...As well as a place to describe construction quality and special features such as energy efficient upgrades.

You'll also discover what an appraiser looks for when evaluating your neighborhood including density and growth trends.

I also include a section on how to accurately describe the site and zoning classifications - an essential but overlooked part of every appraisal.

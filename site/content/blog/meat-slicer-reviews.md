<p>First off, what should you look for in a meat slicer for home use? </p>
<p>Well, during my extensive research of the leading products available today there were a few factors that stood out. <strong>The key factors that made a great food slicer were quality of construction, size and cut thickness.</strong></p>
<p>My favorite food slicer scored high in each of these categories which was important to me. But, if you need special features from your future slicer, you may need to change your shopping criteria. </p>
<p>For example, most slicers take up a ton of counter space or cabinet space. If you have limited space in your kitchen you’ll need to look at the compact versions.</p>
<h2>Top Pick: Chef’s Choice 615a Premium Electric Food Slicer</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/product/B078YYDF8N/US/doorways-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chefs_choice_615_premium_electric_food_slicer-300x300.jpg" alt="chefs choice 615 premium electric food slicer" width="300" height="300" ></a>The Chef’s Choice 615a is one of the top selling electric food slicers because it’s built with high-quality parts but is available at an affordable price. Although it’s built for home use, you can get the same results as with a commercial meat slicer for just a fraction of the price.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, it’s designed to slice a wide range of foods including meat, vegetables, breads and cheeses. Just imagine the possibilities!</strong></p>
<p>Take a look around your kitchen, you probably already own a Chef’s Choice product. The brand has been a household name in the small kitchen appliances industry since 1985. Some of their most popular products include knife sharpeners, professional cutlery and even waffle makers.</p>
<p>If size is an issue in your kitchen, please take note that this slicer is 15″ by 11″ by 11″. While it does not have the biggest footprint, some of my readers have mentioned that it’s larger than they expected. So, I’d suggest pulling out your tape measure and survey your countertop or cabinet to verify that you have room.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I love the <a href="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/product/B078YYDF8N/US/doorways-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chef’s Choice 615a is because it is built to last</a>. Since it’s constructed with cast aluminum and stainless steel it will hold up to almost anything you throw at it. When you pull it out of the box, you can tell it’s well built because it weighs over 13 pounds!</p>
<p>The 615 disassembles easily so you can clean it after every use. You can remove the blade, food carriage, food pusher, food deflector and thickness guide plate quickly and easily. Because this slicer is so easy to clean and assemble you’ll be more likely to use it every week for years to come. Unlike other models that are complicated and hard to clean, the 615 is very straight forward.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking at other models, you may be wondering about the differences between the 609, 610 and 615a. </p>
<p>They are all almost identical including their blade size, capacity and maximum thickness. The main differences are the watt ratings and material construction. The 615a has a 120 watt motor to power the blade, whereas the 610 only has 100 watt motor. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chefs_choice_non_serrated_blade-300x300.jpg" alt="chefs choice non serrated blade" width="300" height="300" >The Chef’s Choice 615 has a 7 inch stainless steel serrated blade that comes with the slicer. You can use this on almost any foods and meats you want. However, if you want to get deli-style thin lunch meat you’ll need to <a  href="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/product/B000X1EOTO/US/doorways-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">purchase a separate non-serrated blade.</a></p>
<p>Even without this additional blade you’ll be able to get fairly thin slices and all the way up to a ¾ inch thickness.</p>

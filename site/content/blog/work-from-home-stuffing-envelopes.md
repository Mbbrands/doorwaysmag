If you've spent anytime searching for ways to work from home stuffing envelopes, you are probably sick of people telling you it's a scam.

The truth is that there are many ways to make money stuffing envelopes. Unfortunately, most articles about this topic don't tell you the steps you need to get started.

That's why I wanted to outline a few of the easiest ways to start an envelope stuffing business from your living room.

## Work from Home as an Administrative Assistant



While lots of websites like to warn you that envelope stuffing jobs are a scam, the fact remains that people get paid to stuff envelopes at their job everyday.

For instance, a quick search on Indeed.com (a job posting site) reveals that there are hundreds of legitimate full-time jobs that include "stuffing envelopes" in the job description:

One of these jobs is called an Administrative or Office Assistant.

Since you want to work from home rather than in an office, it will take some creativity to become a location independent Administrative Assistant - but it is not impossible.

First, get in touch with friends or family members that work at small to medium sized local businesses. See if they are looking for administrative help and propose that you would be willing to do the job from home for reduced pay. 

If this does not yield any results, don't give up yet! 

Next, start asking around at some of the businesses you have relationships with to see if they need extra office help. A few ideas to consider include your hair salon, real estate agent, dental office, insurance company, bank or gym - just to name a few.

Just remember that an employer may not be willing to pay the going-rate for an off-site administrative assistant - but that's okay. After you prove yourself as a hardworking and loyal employee, then you can renegotiate to a more competitive wage.



## Start a Direct Mail Marketing Business



In our Internet dependent world, you would think direct mail would be less effective for small business advertising - but it's not!

According to the Direct Marketing Association, 70% of Americans believe regular mail is more personal than the Internet.  

And, not only do people like getting mail but they actually read it. A [study by USPS](https://www.usps.com/business/pdf/Acquisition_WP1.pdf) reports that 23% of direct mail recipients visit the sender's store location afterward.

Not to mention, companies are still spending a ton of money sending catalogs and coupons every month. 

**The [latest data](https://thedma.org/marketing-insights/marketing-statistics/direct-mail-statistics/) estimates that $8.9 billion was spent on direct mail advertising in 2016!**

Don't you want a chunk of that business?

You can get in on the action by starting your own direct mail marketing business from home. To get started, you'll need to contact local businesses and offer to help them create new direct mail advertising campaigns.

Your business offerings could include advertisement or flyer design, printing, and of course envelope stuffing!

To make this successful you'll need to put in the work, but with a little effort and persistence there could be a big payoff down the road.



## Setup Affiliate Relationships with Local Businesses



If you attempt to start your own local direct mail marketing business as we suggested above, it might be a bumpy road. One of the most common obstacles you might face is a limited advertising budget for direct mail marketing. 

A survey by [MerchantCircle](http://www.merchantcircle.com/corporate/press/2011-01-15-social-marketing-continues-meteoric-rise-among-local-businesses.html) reveals that more than half of local merchants in the United States spend less than $2,500 per year on marketing. That doesn't leave much room in their budget for new direct mail campaigns.

However, there's a better way!

Instead of asking business owners to pay upfront for advertising, you can agree to earn a commission on each person you refer to their business. 

Sometimes this is called a referral or finder's fee. In online advertising this is called affiliate marketing.

Only after someone you refer to a local business makes a purchase will you get a commision on the sale.

One way to keep track of your referrals is to design special coupons that you mail out to local residents. Every time someone uses one of your coupons, you will earn a commision on the sale.

But, don't worry it might not be as risky as it seems.

According to the [Direct Marketing Association](https://thedma.org/), 39% of customers try a business for the first time because of direct mail advertising. That's good news for your envelope stuffing business!

If you get good at creating direct mail advertisements for local businesses and sending them out, you could start earning referral fees all over town.



## Help Promote Local Events



One category of local businesses that uses direct mail almost exclusively is event promoters. The best way to get the word out about local events is to send event flyers to nearby residents.

These flyers need to be stuffed in envelopes and mailed out. If you work closely with the event coordinator this a job you could probably do at home while you watch TV.

The best part is that you won't have to pay for the flyer, envelopes or postage - the event promoter will take care of everything.

Of course, the downside is that they may only pay by the hour or a minimal fee to stuff all of the envelopes. Don't give up on the idea yet, though. Every town, no matter how small has dozens of events each year that you could help with.

If you want to get a temporary job stuffing envelopes, reach out to anyone that puts on events in your town.

Keep an open mind and you'll be surprised at the amount of opportunities that appear in front of you.



## Work with Nonprofit Organizations



When searching for envelope stuffing jobs, it is important to keep in mind the type of organizations that need to reach local residents.

Many nonprofit organizations and charities use direct mail to solicit donations and volunteers for their causes.

Since most organizations like these have small budgets, it is likely that they stuff their own envelopes rather than hiring a print shop to do it for them.

This is your chance to offer your services. Let them know that you are available to help with their project.

Again since nonprofits do not have huge budgets, you might not make a fortune helping them with their direct mail efforts. However, if you are looking to make some side income, this could be a great opportunity for both you and them to work together.

The best part is that your help with their campaign just might make a difference in your community or change the world!

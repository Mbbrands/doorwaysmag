<h2>Common Frigidaire Dishwasher Problems</h2>

In our experience with Frigidaire dishwashers, we found that the most common problems were caused by recent power outages.

When there is a power failure the dishwasher will display the PF error code. This is an alert that the power to the appliance has dropped by 10 percent or more. To reset this code, open and close the dishwasher door. If this error code appears frequently, check that the voltage to the appliance is adequate.

You are likely to encounter the HO error code if you have a small or old hot water heater.

This fault code means that the cycle has been delayed until the hot water supplied to the dishwasher reaches operating temperature. If you see this error frequently, turn on the hot water at the kitchen faucet before starting the dishwasher cycle. This will remove any cold water that is sitting in the lines and allow the dishwasher to start immediately.

The LO error code is an indication that the rinse aid level is low. To clear this code, refill the rinse aid dispenser to the appropriate level. If the problem continues you may need to check the wiring, replace the reed switch, or repair the dispenser assembly.

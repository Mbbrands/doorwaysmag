Stop me if you've heard (or said) this before, "..Maybe we can hang that neon light in the garage instead of the living room?"

If you and your significant other can't seem to agree on decor, then maybe it's time to dedicate a room in your home for a man cave. 

So, what exactly is a man cave? 

It's a space within a house (or garage) where a grown man can display and enjoy all of his favorite stuff. Things like head mounts, dart boards and sports memorabilia are commonly found here. 

More importantly, it's a room where a man's wife doesn't have to look at this stuff everyday. 

You could say it's the key to every successful marriage.

Since we are big fans of happy and healthy marriages, we've assembled 17 man cave ideas that will make both husbands and wives happy. In this gallery you'll find design ideas for sports fans, outdoorsmen, car lovers and handymen. 

Below each photo we include tips on how to incorporate these ideas into your own home as well as product suggestions. 



## For Sports Fans

Although it would be awesome to have multiple TV's mounted in the living room, it probably won't fly with your significant other. So, why not install a few big screens in your man cave? This room has 5 TV's so you can watch all the big games at once. The dark furniture and built-ins are a great contrast to the white jerseys and memorabilia mounted on the walls.

Some men are forced to watch sports in the basement, but this is a great example of what you can do in an attic. They've enclosed the space above the TV to improve the acoustics and painted the accent wall a dark blue to make the space look larger. This room also features accent lighting above the couch and dark wood wainscoting around the room.

Not only is this a great place to watch sports but also grab a drink with your buddies. In the center of the room is a large bar with 4 bar stools. Behind the bar is shelving to display bottles as well as a flat screen TV. There are two leather arm chairs at one end of the room next to a pool table and a large sectional couch at the other end.

Don't like golfing in the rain or waiting behind a slow 4-some? Why not stay at home and play a round of golf. This man cave features a golf simulator and a full size pool table. The stacked stone wall and dark wood furniture gives this space a warm and comfortable setting to relax and hang out.

If you love baseball, you'll love this room. Along the walls are baseball jerseys, bats and balls displayed in dark wood cases. Like other rooms in this gallery, this room has dark colored walls which help contrast the items on the wall. 



## For Outdoorsmen

For some guys a room just isn't big enough for all their stuff. If this is the case, then a garage is also the perfect male sanctuary. Whether you like to hunt, fish or work on cars, there's plenty of room in this hunting barn. 

![gun display room](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gun_display_man_cave.jpg)

Wish you could display your guns instead of hiding them in the safe? Why not decorate the walls of your private oasis with your favorite guns? This room has special accent lighting installed to showcase the objects along the wall for closer inspection. Also, the rustic wood shelving is a great contrast to the white tufted furniture.

If there's not enough space in your home for a man cave, a man closet just might have to do. This hunting closet is a great place to organize and display your favorite gear. The shelves and drawers are perfect for storing items that you use every weekend. Never lose your gear again.

We had to include this hunting lodge as part of our collection of man caves. Although everyone doesn't have this much extra space in their homes, it is something to work towards. Not only does this room have a bar, pool table and shuffleboard but it also features a moose antler chandelier. 



## For Car Lovers

## Conclusion



During our research we found hundreds of design ideas but we had to narrow it down to the 17 best man caves. Let me tell you that this was no easy task. 

What we discovered was that the most impressive rooms were the ones that selectively displayed memorabilia. While it can be tempting to hang every poster or fill every cabinet with souvenirs, our best advice is to choose carefully.

If you have too many objects you want to fit in a small space, you can always rotate memorabilia throughout the year or as the seasons change.

When you are decorating a man cave, don't forget to paint the walls and add accent lighting to highlight important items. Other than that, enjoy the process and make it your own.

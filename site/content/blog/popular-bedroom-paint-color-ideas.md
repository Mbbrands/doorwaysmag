As an architectural consultant, I've helped homeowners design and build their dream homes, but lately something strange has been happening. Suddenly, my articles on exterior paint colors and [kitchen cabinet colors](http://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/kitchen-cabinet-colors/) have become extremely popular. 

In fact, my inbox gets filled with color related questions faster than I can respond. So, today it's time to venture into another area of the home. Follow along as I walk you through the most popular bedroom paint color ideas.

When it comes to picking colors, most people read or listen to my tips, and then still end up making a poor decision despite what I told them. That's okay, because of the few that end up living in homes that look like they were designed by the color-blind, thousands of others have had success. 

The reason I tell you this, is because choosing the wrong color for your bedroom can lead to serious consequences. [Studies have found](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2325476/Want-good-nights-sleep-Find-colours-use-bedroom-avoid-decent-kip.html) that warm colors like purple and red stimulate your brain - exactly the opposite of what you want in your bedroom. 

**Warm colors can cause you to sleep less, become irritable, and even have less sex!**

Here's a few of our favorite bedroom paint color ideas:

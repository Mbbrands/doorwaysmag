San Tropez, Brazilian Gold, Vecchia Oro or the granite most commonly known as Venetian Gold ranks amongst one of the most desired light colored granites in the market. Despite the name, Venetian Gold has no relation to Italy; the stone originates from bedrock quarries throughout parts of Brazil. 

Venetian Gold granite is present in so many kitchens for its one of a kind appearance, versatile color scheme, durable qualities and affordable, mid-range price.



## Color Palette Ideas



Many admire Venetian Gold for it's renowned creamy beige and gold tones. The abundance of black mineral deposits beautifully decorates the light colored bedrock, along with fewer, various shades of gray and red deposits. 

Adding to Venetian Gold's unique appearance, white veining brightens the black, gray and red flecks in a uniformed pattern. 

A range of colors can easily compliment the natural stone to create a perfect kitchen. The mineral deposits of the granite pair well with dark colored cabinets such as brown or black, giving the kitchen a bold, luxurious look. 

Stained wood cabinets compliment Venetian Gold's light earthy tones, creating a naturally inviting kitchen that is seamless from cabinets to countertop. 

Or perhaps, add more elegant flow to a kitchen by pairing the granite with off-white cabinets. Whether a rich dramatic or a seamlessly bright preference, Venetian Gold's versatility makes almost any look possible. 



## Is Venetian Gold Easy to Maintain?



Granite adds a luxurious appearance to any kitchen but is also ideal for its long lasting qualities and minimal upkeep. Manufacturers apply epoxy resin to the natural stone during the polishing process, filling any porous areas to ensure the structure. 

This high-density material is durable enough to withstand everyday kitchen use, in fact, Venetian Gold is highly resistant to heat, scratches, and stains. 

Also, the granite's patterns and light color scheme hide excessive fingerprints and dirt reasonably well. 

The smooth, polished countertop makes cleaning a breeze. It is important to use a non-abrasive natural stone cleaner or mild soap and warm water when needed. 

For preservation, experts recommend resealing the granite once a year, which is a simple and quick process. 



## How Much Does Venetian Gold Cost?



Venetian Gold is readily available as slab, prefabricated, and tile granite. 

Slab granite starts at $35 to $45 per square foot installed and could increase to $50 to $70 per square foot installed. The slab prices depend on the decorative edging and the fabricated complexity of the raw stone. 

Manufacturers offer large, prefabricated slabs that already have cut-outs and a designed edge, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 after installation. 

For the DIY'ers, tile granite costs on average $5 to $10 per square foot plus material costs for installation. 

Venetian Gold is considered a mid-range priced granite. Comparable materials such as Colonial Cream and Golden Beach are typically $10 to $20 more per square foot. On the other hand, Giallo Ornamental is a less expensive alternative. 

## Conclusion

The choices are endless for countertop materials - marble, stainless steel, wood, and laminate - however, these choices are typically narrowed down to granite for several reasons. 

By choosing Venetian Gold, the creamy earth tones can bring an old world charm or a seaside feel to any modern kitchen. The light, smooth surface will remain beautiful after years of use and will bring a luxury centerpiece without breaking the budget. 

Whether designing from scratch or renovating a kitchen, Venetian Gold will turn any ordinary kitchen into a magazine worthy space.

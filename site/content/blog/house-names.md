**Trying to decide on the perfect name for your new home? No worries, we rounded up 61 of the best house names to help you get started.**





For most of us, our homes are only known by their street address or house number.





Unless you live at _1600 Pennsylvania Avenue_ or _740 Park Avenue_, your address rarely carries very much weight in conversation.





So, what should you do instead?





**Give your house a unique name!**





The list below includes popular words to add before or after the name of your house. For example, you could combine your last name or surname with one of the words below, such as _Smith Farmhouse_ or _Johnson Manor_.





Another strategy would be to use the geography around your house for inspiration. These could include names like _Little House on the Swamp_ or _Lake View Estate_.

**The Property Brothers**, Drew and Jonathan Scott, are known for taking extreme fixer-uppers and turning them into the ultimate dream home. 

Their show on HGTV has become a major hit with DIY homeowners. It’s simple to see why. They have a proven record for taking homes that need substantial work and giving them a face lift in record time and on a budget. Most of their projects are completed within four to six weeks and often for under $50,000. How do they do it? 

Below we outline 5 extreme home renovation tips from the Property Brothers, Drew and Jonathan Scott.

_Update:_ After reading this article many people have been wondering: **Can I hire the property brothers?** Unfortunately, the Scott Brothers no longer take on real estate clients outside of the shows (according to their website). The good news is that you can still get home design tips for your project by joining our community.



## Tip #1: Use Your Creative License



The key to turning an average house into your dream home is using creativity and looking beyond the basics. 

The Property Brothers are known for using 3D renderings to show homeowners their remodeling plans. Although homeowners might not be able to use high-tech tools to plan and design their improvement projects, there are options available.

A short consultation with an interior designer or architect may produce a new perspective on your renovation project. A local designer may be able to provide some basic renderings at a low cost, too. Not only will you get professional advice, but you may end up rethinking your design strategy all together.

For DIY designers looking to not spend a fortune on professional help there are a few creative solutions available online. For example, the Autodesk Homestyler is an online home design application that brings your interior design plans and remodeling dreams to life. It allows you to create floor plans and generate 3D renderings that you can save, print or share online.



## Tip #2: Don’t Over-Renovate

Even though the Property Brothers are famous for taking extreme fixer-uppers and turning them into beautiful homes, they warn that you shouldn’t over renovate. Undertaking a major renovation project can be costly. 

In this market it’s important to begin with the end in mind. If it’s going to cost more to renovate than you will ever get back after the sale maybe it’s time to rethink your plans.



<blockquote>“Don’t get in over your head. It’s very easy to say ‘Oh well, what’s an additional 30 or 50 grand?’ But don’t do it. It’s all about the numbers.” -Jonathan Scott </blockquote>



While there are many home improvement projects that can turn a quick buck for smart homeowners, others can make money disappear into thin air. 

Make smart decisions when starting a remodeling project by looking at popular home features in your neighborhood and current home prices. These elements can keep your design choices in check and prevent you from over-renovating and spending a fortune only to regret it later.



## Tip #3: Don’t Be Penny Wise and Pound Foolish

The DIY home improvement movement has exploded in recent years. Thanks to an abundance of design websites, TV shows and magazines everyone seems to be an expert. 

With a wealth of design information available more couples are jumping into ambitious remodeling projects than ever before, often with little or no experience. Although undertaking any home design project can be fun and rewarding, it’s usually not an ideal use of your resources to do it yourself.



<blockquote>“People want to DIY, which is fine, but they’re not valuing their time and money on the project. It might have taken a person a week to put in a tile floor that it took a professional one day to do.” -Drew Scott</blockquote>



The high upfront cost of hiring a professional usually scares many homeowners into doing it themselves. Not to mention, the horror stories that are the basis for shows like _Holmes on Homes_ prevent many people from calling a contractor for help. 

But, the help of a professional will usually provide long-term value and save you countless hours of frustration and headaches. In addition, if you make a mistake or take a shortcut the project could end up costing you thousands of dollars down the road to redo or fix. 

**When undertaking an ambitious remodeling project be smart about which tasks you tackle yourself and let someone else handle the rest.**



## Tip #4: Hire a Quality Contractor

Not all contractors are created equal. Especially when you’re looking at local contractors there is often a wide range of quality available. Your neighbors may have recommendations for a great contractor or horror stories from a remodel gone wrong. Use these opinions to narrow down your choices but make sure you get multiple estimates before moving forward.



<blockquote>“Do your research, get three contractors to give you estimates and get it all in writing. Confirm that they’re associated with reputable organizations. Make sure that they’re licensed, but remember that just because they’re licensed, does not mean they are good at what they do. If you get that red-flag feeling at all, there’s a reason for that.” -Jonathan Scott</blockquote>



Also consider asking for testimonials from previous clients. If possible, try and contact a few of their local clients to get a real feel for their quality of work. These homeowners may be able to share valuable insights from their experience that can improve your chance of success.



## Tip #5: Enjoy the Process



The most important takeaway from the Property Brothers is to have fun and enjoy the process. Home improvement projects usually take a substantial amount of time and money to complete. 

**If you’re not having fun along the way it can be a miserable process, if not a complete nightmare.**

At the end of the project you should have some great memories in your new home. The pride that comes from completing a home improvement project on your own is a unique and almost addicting sensation. 

However, not all projects go as planned. 

It’s the obstacles and challenges that make your renovation projects memorable. So enjoy the process and have fun along the way.

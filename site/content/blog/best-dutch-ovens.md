A Dutch oven is a type of cooking pot with big walls and a tight fitting lid. There are many different types of dutch ovens on the market.  

The two most popular types include those used primarily on the stovetop or in the oven, and types used for cooking outdoors during activities like camping. Keep in mind, many can be used for both purposes.

One of the biggest benefits that come from a Dutch oven is the versatility that it offers the user. There is almost nothing that cannot be prepared in a Dutch oven. People use it to braise, roast, fry, and bake all types of food. 

Dutch ovens require practically no maintenance and get better with age. It is important to take proper care of a Dutch oven by keeping it well-seasoned so long it does not rust. This type of cookware can be used over a fire, on the stove top, in the oven, and even on the grill.

Dutch ovens can be made from a variety of materials including cast iron, clay, and ceramic materials. Dutch ovens come in a variety of attractive colors and styles and are relatively affordable choices for almost any budget, especially when you consider how many other types of cookware it can replace. Many people even have multiple Dutch ovens in varying sizes so that they can cook a variety of foods at once. 

**Here are a few of the best Dutch ovens on the market that receive the highest satisfaction ratings from consumers:**

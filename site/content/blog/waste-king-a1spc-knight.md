Garbage disposal units often tend to be large, clunky, unpleasant to look at and noisy to use. You can, however, throw these old notions out of the window with one look at the sleek and modern Waste King A1SPC Knight 1.0 Horsepower Garbage Disposal system. 

A product of decades worth of experience on the part of Anaheim Manufacturing, the Waste King A1SPC Knight is one of our favorites.

This unit is a great representative of the Waste King line of [disposal systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_disposal_unit), with great features, easy installation and virtually maintenance-free operation. The power and versatility on offer makes it a great product for your kitchen.

## Specifications



Do not let the small size and light weight of the Waste King A1SPC Knight fool you. The unit, measuring at 8.8 X 8.8 X 15 inches and weighing only 18.4 pounds packs quite a punch. 

The shipment package include the Waste King unit, insulated power cord, an easy to use snap and lock mounting system for seamless installation, and an included drain elbow. The versatile mount works with most sink drains without the need to use a separate adapter. 



## Build Quality and Functionality



The Waste King A1SPC Knight Disposal uses stainless steel, plastic and rubber material to great effect, combining these for a premium look while keeping the unit affordable. The high power 2,700 RPM, 1.0 HP motor is adequate for medium to heavy household use. 

With the use of patented one-pass technology, there is no need for multiple disposal chambers. The motor has enough power to pulverize all your kitchen waste with one single pass. The heavy-duty body naturally resists corrosion and wear, even in the most trying of circumstances.




## Noise and Warranty



One amazing feature of the Waste King A1SPC Knight Disposal is the super quiet operation, thanks to the use of new and exclusive silencer technology, which is the same technology used to make music studios sound proof. 

**The glass-filled nylon interiors of the grinding chamber make it naturally resistant to corrosion and you are assured of getting many years of faithful service from this unit.**

The manufacturers accompany this unit with an attractive [lifetime in-home limited mechanical warranty](http://www.waste-king.com/wastekingwarranty.html), which ensures that in the event of mechanical faults and corrosion, all the servicing would be home for free inside your own home.

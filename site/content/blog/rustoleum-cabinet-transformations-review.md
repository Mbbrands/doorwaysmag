Over the last year I've helped hundreds of homeowners transform their kitchens with my painting kitchen cabinets guide. The results have been incredible. 

However, countless others have been discouraged to start this ambitious project after I tell them the amount of prep work required to get great results. As I always say, if you want professional looking cabinets, you need to prepare like a pro.

The tried and true way to paint kitchen cabinets is to sand, prime, sand and finally, paint. The good news is that there's an easier way to do it. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RX0YMU?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Your shortcut is called Rustoleum Cabinet Transformations</a>. It will completely eliminate the need to sand. You can thank me later.


## The Easy Way to Paint Your Cabinets

To change the look of your cabinets, it only takes three simple steps using Rustoleum Cabinet Transformations. 

First, you'll need to apply the deglosser, which removes any shine or finish from the cabinets. The Transformation kit includes deglosser and a scrub pad to help you clean the surfaces to be painted.

Next, apply two coats of of the supplied Bond Coat. Similar to a primer, the bond coat will give you a solid and smooth foundation for your top coat. However, unlike primer, you don't need to sand it before applying your final paint.

Finally, just brush on the protective top coat. The final paint coat included in the Transformations kit is designed to be stain and scratch resistant. 

If you're looking for paint that will give you a "long-lasting, durable finish," I have good news: it's included in the kit!

Another advantage of using a kit like this is that it also includes everything you need to add a decorative glaze to your cabinets. If you're following along at home, the glaze is applied after the bond coat and before the protective top coat.



## What's Included in the Kit?



I'm going to let you in on a secret of mine. Why should you buy a kit instead of purchasing all of the items individually?

Because there are a TON of supplies you need to paint your kitchen cabinets.

Earlier this year I was at my favorite hardware store picking up a few paint supplies for a cabinet refinishing project I was working on. **The next thing I knew, my cart was filled and then my wallet was empty.** 

It was at this moment I realized that I should create a printable shopping list for my readers to make it easy for them to get everything they needed in one trip to the paint store. Guess what happened when I emailed my readers to see if they were interested in something like this? 

My inbox got flooded with responses!

While you can still download my shopping list to save money and get the job done quickly, there's an easier way. 

When you buy the Rustoleum Transformation Kit it comes with almost everything you need to get the job done right. 

**Here's what's included in the box:**


  * Bottle of Deglosser


  * Can of Bond Coat


  * Decorative Glaze


  * Protective Top Coat


  * Decorative Glazing Cloths


  * Scrub Pads


  * Stir Sticks



**Items Needed but not included**




  * (3) 2" Synthetic Paint Brushes - Premium Quality


  * (1) 2" Foam Paint Brush (for optional glaze)


  * Smooth Painter's Tape (2" size)


  * Drop Cloths


  * Disposable Gloves


  * Lint-Free Rags


  * Disposable Paint Containers





## Available Colors



Painting your cabinets is pretty straight forward, but picking a color can be almost impossible for some. It's no wonder my article on popular kitchen cabinet colors gets so much traffic. 

If you're struggling with this problem too, I have some good news. You are guaranteed to find a color you love because the Transformations kit is available in 70 different colors!

You can either purchase a light or dark color kit and use the tinting to get the exact color you want. They also offer premixed colors like Espresso and Cabernet so you can get started without all the fuss.

Another great feature of this kit is that it will help you transform your cabinets no matter what they are made of. The special coating that's included in your kit will cover up wood, laminate and even melamine surfaces.



## Conclusion


As I've pointed out, there are really only two ways to go about painting your kitchen cabinets yourself. The first is to do the prep work yourself. This is the only way to guarantee that you will end up with cabinets you'll love. That means sanding, priming, sanding again and painting - a time consuming process. 

Your other option is to use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RX0YMU?tag=doorways-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pre-made kit like Rustoleum Cabinet Transformations</a>, so you can completely skip sanding all together.

## Company Background


The company first opened its doors in 1970 and has continued to transform kitchens ever since. 

Today the company is a subsidiary of [MasterBrand Cabinets](http://www.masterbrand.com/), the biggest cabinet manufacturer in North America. MasterBrand is based in Jasper, IN, and the Diamond cabinet products are manufactured in the US.

The company holds tight to its FourEver Promise, which promises beauty, function, strength, and performance in every Diamond cabinetry product. 

## Construction Quality

Diamond cabinets are built with a load-bearing back using a 3/8” thick back panel covering both the width and the height of their box.  This construction ensures that the cabinet will last for many years to come. 

This unique construction method sets Diamond cabinets apart from other brands that have an obstructing center divider.

**Wood Options include:**

  * Alder


  * Cherry


  * Maple


  * Oak


  * Rustic Alder



**The standard cabinet box features the following construction features:**


  * 1/2” board sides and bottom support


  * 1/2” thick furniture board I-beam braces for shipping and installation stability


  * 3/8” solid furniture board back


  * 3/4” solid hardwood face frame


  * 6-way adjustable and concealed hinges


  * Laminated exterior that matches the selected finish



Diamond cabinets also allow customers to select plywood upgrades, providing and accommodating different budgets and quality requirements. 

Standard drawer features include an integrated hydraulic cylinder for a smoother close, full extension, under-mounted guides, and 3/4” thick dovetail sides. The doors also have a _Smart Stop door system_ that allows the doors to close softly. This feature can be turned off easily if needed.

Other unique features offered by Diamond Cabinets include roll trays and standard pullouts for pantry and waste basket needs. 


## Common Complaints


After consulting with our readers some said they experienced inconsistencies in the stain. A large majority also voiced that the customer support was very poor. 

Be sure to inspect your cabinets carefully before installation as several have noted off-square doors and hairline fractures in the wood.

To avoid frustration, plan for a time cushion so you are not frustrated by delays in shipment or reshipment due to damaged factory pieces.

Diamond Cabinets strives to put beauty, strength, and functionality into each of its cabinets. When browsing their selection, it is quickly apparent that the cabinets thoughtfully designed for easy organization.  

And while not the cheapest brand, Diamond’s price range is still considered affordable. With it’s wide array of options it is easy to find what you are looking for. The Limited Lifetime Warranty makes it evident that Diamond firmly believes in the quality of their cabinets.

![insinkerator badger 5 installation](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/insinkerator_badger_5_installation-300x300.jpg)Being an experienced kitchen designer, you'd think I'd only know about the newest trends in countertop finishes and kitchen cabinet colors - but you'd be wrong. I believe every element in a kitchen should be carefully selected and reviewed - including garbage disposals - before they are deemed worthy of your kitchen.

Even though I don't work with individual clients anymore, you can still take advantage of my vast knowledge of kitchen appliances without having to pay for my design services by the hour. (whew!)

Whether you are looking for your first garbage disposal or an upgrade to your existing unit, I hope this guide proves to be useful. 

I used 3 main criteria when selecting the best garbage disposal on the market today. These included horsepower, feed style and overall noise (or lack thereof). All of which work hand in hand to offer a seamless experience for you while doing the dishes and cleaning up after dinner.

**Here are the top models with 1 horsepower I compared for this article:**

**Note:** I typically recommend only disposers with 1 horsepower for households with 3 or more people. One of the reasons is because of extreme wear and tear. 

That's because the top complaints about disposals are usually around premature motor failure. If you read a few reviews on Amazon, you'll notice the same pattern. Many reviewers claim that lower horsepower models tend to burn out after 5 years. This is likely due to overloading. 

Garbage disposals are only meant to breakdown semi-soft foods - not bones, carrots and potatoes. However, everyone, including my girlfriend, believes a disposal is as strong as a BlendTech blender - (see [Will it Blend?](https://youtu.be/lAl28d6tbko) on YouTube) 

But they're not. 

So, save yourself the hassle of having to replace your unit in a few years, and go with a higher powered model. You'll thank me later. 

That being said, not everyone is a horsepower junkie like myself. In that case you may want to look at smaller units. For instance, if you rarely use your disposal you could get away with a ½ or ¾ horsepower unit. Here are a few of the top rated smaller units.

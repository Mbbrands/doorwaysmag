You might be asking yourself, what is Uba Tuba? As unique as the name sounds, it is one of the most frequently used granites for kitchen countertops due to its luxurious look and affordable price. 

The interestingly named Uba Tuba granite is shipped in large quantities throughout the world from bedrock quarries in [southeastern Brazil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)). 

This natural stone is a late Cambrian [charnockite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnockite) consisting of green feldspars, black pyroxene, and quartz, creating a granite that is dark green with earth toned specks. 

Depending on the shade of green, Uba Tuba granite is also referred to as Verde Ubatuba, Amazonas Green, Butterfly, and Verde Labrador.  

Uba Tuba's glimmering appearance, long-lasting durability, and design options combine to make the granite highly sought after by builders and homeowners alike. 



## Color and Design Ideas



At first, Uba Tuba has a black, glass-like appearance however if looked at more closely, it is a medium grained, green granite that consists of gold, white, brown and turquoise specks. 

The shade of green can vary from slab to slab, typically if the stone consists of a lighter green it will be marked as "verde". 

Earth toned specks of various sizes and hues beautifully decorate Uba Tuba's green stone, which are separated by sparkling gold or white veining. Uba Tuba has a smooth, glossy finish that enhances the luxury of the granite. 

Also, Uba Tuba is highly versatile and can be complemented with almost any color. Uba Tuba countertops can easily be paired with black, cherry, or rich wood cabinets to accentuate the bold color features. Or choose a more vibrant look by matching the countertop with mint green, creme, or light maple cabinets. 



## Care and Maintenance



In addition to Uba Tuba's one of a kind appearance, it is top of the list for durability and maintenance. Uba Tuba is the densest granite in the market and can withstand years of everyday use. The scratch and stain resistant qualities protect the granite from spills, sharp objects, and scolding kitchen items. 

Most experts recommend resealing the countertop every three to four years to preserve the resistant qualities. Cleaning the smooth stone is simple, use mild soap and warm water or a non-abrasive, natural cleaner that will prevent any stripping of the natural finish. In addition, a granite polish can be applied two to three times per year to maintain the black polished look.



## Average Cost



Walking into a kitchen with Uba Tuba countertops, many would expect the exotic and glossy granite is only available at a premium but it is actually budget friendly. 

Typically, this natural stone is available in three ways. The highest quality, custom installed, Uba Tuba slab granite ranges from an average of $40 to $80 per square foot depending on edge choice and cut-out. For those seeking prefabricated Uba Tuba slabs prices range from $15 to $25 per square foot with a $200 to $400 installation fee. 

The least expensive option and a popular choice for DIY'ers, Uba Tuba tiles are available for as little as $6 to $10 per square foot. Keep in mind, swatch samples may not best represent the slab of granite, before purchasing it is important that the buyer is satisfied with the entire piece of Uba Tuba.

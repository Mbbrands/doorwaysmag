I started collecting kitchen backsplash ideas on our Pinterest page a few weeks ago and the response has been incredible. 

One thing you might notice is that many of these ideas can to turn your ordinary kitchen into a gourmet workspace. 

The best part is that you may be able to install these by yourself. Let me tell you that these kitchen backsplash ideas will certainly separate you from your crafty neighbors. They may even ask you who you hired to design your kitchen - at which you say that you did it all yourself.

<p>The most common question I get about kitchen backsplash ideas is how to design with tile. After all it’s inexpensive, easy to maintain and is extremely durable.</p>

<p>An extremely popular kitchen backsplash is subway tile. It is a great option because it works in traditional kitchens and even in contemporary spaces as well. </p>
<p>Subway tile normally comes in white, rectangular pieces. This style will give you a clean and timeless look, while still being easy to clean. White subway tile goes great with white kitchen cabinets.</p>
<div id="attachment_1693" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_green_backsplash.jpg" alt="white kitchen green backsplash" width="800" height="530" class="size-full wp-image-1693" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_green_backsplash.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_green_backsplash-510x338.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_green_backsplash-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/1564555/Kitchens-contemporary-kitchen-new-york" target="_blank">Clean Design</a></p></div>
<p>If you’re thinking about painting your cabinets, I’d recommend grabbing a copy of my free guide on how to paint kitchen cabinets before you install a new backsplash. You’ll be glad you did.</p>
<div id="attachment_1692" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/stone_kitchen_backsplash_ideas.jpg" alt="stone kitchen backsplash ideas" width="800" height="524" class="size-full wp-image-1692" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/stone_kitchen_backsplash_ideas.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/stone_kitchen_backsplash_ideas-510x334.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/stone_kitchen_backsplash_ideas-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/411722/Itasca-Il-Kitchen-Design-and-Remodel-traditional-kitchen-chicago" target="_blank">Design First Builders</a></p></div>
<p>Another one of the most popular kitchen backsplash ideas is stone. As you can see in this example, a stone backsplash will give almost any kitchen instant character. </p>
<div id="attachment_1691" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rustic_kitchen_stone_backsplash.jpg" alt="rustic kitchen stone backsplash" width="800" height="534" class="size-full wp-image-1691" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rustic_kitchen_stone_backsplash.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rustic_kitchen_stone_backsplash-510x340.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rustic_kitchen_stone_backsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">&gt; Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/14717217/2014-CRBRA-Parade-of-Homes-rustic-kitchen-new-york" target="_blank">Witt Construction</a></p></div>
<p>The texture and color of the stone provides a rich look and feel that will make your kitchen feel like a custom work of art. One of the most underrated parts of a kitchen remodel is the backsplash. </p>

<p>Most builder spec homes rarely come with a backsplash installed, so adding one to your kitchen could really set you apart from your neighbors. It’s these small changes that can really set your house apart when it comes time to sell.</p>
<div id="attachment_1689" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/glass_kitchen_backsplash_ideas.jpg" alt="glass kitchen backsplash ideas" width="800" height="600" class="size-full wp-image-1689" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/glass_kitchen_backsplash_ideas.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/glass_kitchen_backsplash_ideas-510x383.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/glass_kitchen_backsplash_ideas-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/6180/ARCTANGENT-Architecture-Design-modern-kitchen-new-york" target="_blank">Arctangent</a></p></div>
<p>An alternative to a tile or stone backsplash is to use glass. Again, these are extremely easy to clean. They also work well in both traditional and contemporary kitchens. </p>
<div id="attachment_1688" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_glass_tile_backsplash.jpg" alt="white kitchen glass tile backsplash" width="800" height="1045" class="size-full wp-image-1688" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_glass_tile_backsplash.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_glass_tile_backsplash-510x666.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_glass_tile_backsplash-300x392.jpg 300w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/white_kitchen_glass_tile_backsplash-784x1024.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/5761204/Rhode-Island-Beach-House-beach-style-kitchen-boston" target="_blank">Rachel Reider Interiors</a></p></div>
<p>Depending on the color and finish of the glass, you can achieve quite a few different effects. It’s easy to install and cost effective when compared to more traditional kitchen backsplash ideas.</p>

<p>A colored glass backsplash adds contrast to a kitchen with white cabinets and countertops. You could also be adventurous and choose a bright color that would lighten up your kitchen and make it feel bigger. </p>
<p>Using under-cabinet lights is a great way to show off your glass backsplash. The reflections will give you a more dynamic look and feel compared to tile.</p>

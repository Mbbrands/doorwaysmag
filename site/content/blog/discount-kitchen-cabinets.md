The first thing most people think of when they’re looking for cheap kitchen cabinets is IKEA. It’s no surprise considering they offer stylish furniture at extremely competitive prices.

[IKEA cabinets](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/ikea-cabinets/) are cheap because they are made of Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) and you have to assemble them yourself. Unlike natural wood cabinets like Oak or Maple, MDF has a shorter lifespan and does not stand up well to water damage or abuse.

That being said, IKEA cabinets are a great option if you are looking for discount kitchen cabinets that look great.



### RTA Cabinets

Ready to Assemble (RTA) kitchen cabinets are just as they sound - they come in a flat pack box and all you need is a screwdriver to install them. Well, that’s what most RTA cabinets wholesalers tell you, but you might need a few more tools than that.

Since you assemble and install the cabinets yourself they are considerably cheaper than brand name cabinets.

RTA cabinets are available in a wide range of styles and colors. Two of the most popular online wholesale companies are the RTA Store, Shop RTA Cabinets. You can get discount cabinets at Home Depot too.

The Home Depot carries RTA cabinets from Heartland Cabinetry in a variety of styles and colors.



### Used Kitchen Cabinets



One of the most rewarding ways to find name brand kitchen cabinets at discount prices, is to use your creativity. 

There are a few companies that sell showroom kitchen displays to consumers for discount prices. The benefits are that you get high quality kitchen cabinets and the prices cannot be beat. 

Unfortunately, these are stock cabinets and are designed for a showroom layout. That means if you need to make changes, you might have to hire a carpenter to modify the cabinets to fit your kitchen layout.

Another alternative is to look on Craigslist and your local classified ads for used cabinets. It may be hard to find your dream kitchen cabinets on Craigslist, but you could get lucky. 

Might as well look for discount kitchen cabinets in the classifieds before you put your money down on a custom made set of cabinets.



## The Verdict on Cheap Kitchen Cabinets



As you can see there are a few places to get kitchen cabinets at discount prices. But, be careful not to get seduced by the sticker price alone. Kitchen remodeling projects have the highest return on investment when it comes time to sell your home. However, if your cabinets are worn and sagging after a few years you might have a hard time recouping your investment.

Remodeling your kitchen a great way to improve your home value, but it can also be an expensive project if you make a few mistakes along the way. Who can you turn to for help if you have questions during the process?

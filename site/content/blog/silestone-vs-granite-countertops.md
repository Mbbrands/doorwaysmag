As the years have passed, kitchen and bathroom surfaces have changed quite dramatically. Today, it seems as if every homeowner wants countertops that will increase the value of their home. In this article we are comparing Silestone vs granite. When considering countertops, these are two very special types of materials that are both exceptional choices.

While granite is a natural stone, Silestone is a [synthetic material](http://www.silestoneusa.com/what-is-silestone/) that is mainly made from quartz (94%). Both types of materials have a long list of advantages, and like with everything you can purchase, a few disadvantages as well. The pros and cons of Silestone and granite are highlighted below. 



## Silestone Countertop Pros and Cons



Silestone quartz countertops are highly recommended due to their tough and stain-resistant qualities. It is unlikely to stain because it is non-porous, which means that substances like tea, wine, vinegar and even make-up are unable to seep below the surface and leave permanent marks. 

Itâ€™s a virtually indestructible material resistant to acidic liquid, hard knocks or bumps, and scratches. In addition, only Silestone offers unique protection from the accumulation of bacteria on its surfaces, making it even more ideal for kitchen and bathroom areas. 

The one disadvantage of Silestone is that [it is not a natural material](https://youtu.be/-Pfi2cen-wE), and this sometimes makes it look a bit "fake" when it is seen next to a natural stone such as granite. It is also recommended to find out more from a manufacturer about its heat-resistant properties before considering a purchase.



## Granite Countertop Pros and Cons



Granite, especially because it is a natural material, is highly attractive. It has lovely and unique color variations within its grain that gives a room extraordinary aesthetic appeal. 

It is also a material that is highly scratch and heat-resistant. You can go ahead and cut up your vegetables, or put a hot pot down without worrying about damaging the surface. 

Granite does, however, need to be sealed, whereas Silestone does not. This is because granite is a porous material that will absorb fluids. Stains can occur if this happens, and bacteria may accumulate as well. Depending on the type you purchase, re-sealing may be required every couple of years. 



## Cost Comparison: Silestone vs Granite Prices



Cost is always an important factor to consider, and both Silestone and granite are fairly expensive countertop materials. 

Silestone countertops will cost between $100 and $200 per square foot. Their price is mainly determined by the grade of quartz used and the complexity of the work involved. Higher quality quartz will have richer colors, whereas standard grades are plainer in color. 

Granite prices will range between $100 and $250 per square foot, and the premium or designer grades are more expensive. Granite will very likely cost you more than Silestone, depending on the grade of material you choose, but you could consider closeout or clearance grades if you need lower prices. Clearance grade granite usually has less veining and plainer colors, but often still very beautiful. It creates a great, understated look. 

## Conclusion

When deciding which type of countertop will be best for your home, consider the kind of look you wish to create and the level of durability required. While it is often agreed that granite is the more attractive of the two, Silestone is considered as a tougher, more stain-resilient material. 

Granite, however, is fantastically resilient to heat. Perhaps it is unfair to say that granite is more beautiful, because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The colors and textures available in Silestone may just prove to be more to your liking than what nature can offer in granite, although in general, many options are available for both types of material.

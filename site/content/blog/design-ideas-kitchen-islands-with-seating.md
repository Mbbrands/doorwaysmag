<p><strong>Maybe it’s time to look at a few kitchen islands with seating.</strong></p>
<p>Before you throw a few bar stools into your kitchen, there are a few design features you need to be aware of. </p>
<p>First, islands need to have cantilevered countertops or an overhang to allow for a comfortable seating area.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you are planning on adding seating to your kitchen island make sure there is plenty of room. At minimum you should have 42 inches of space on each side of the island, preferably 48 inches if space permits. </p>
<p>On islands with a breakfast bar you can use different countertop materials to add texture and depth to the space. </p>
<p>One mistake many homeowners make is falling in love with chairs for their kitchen island only to find out they don’t fit. Before you go shopping for stools, take a few measurements. Seats must have at least 12 inches of clear knee space below the countertop.</p>
<p><strong>What type of chairs are best for your kitchen island?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Standard bar stools fit underneath 42 to 46 inch high breakfast bars</li>
<li>Counter stools will work with 36 inch high islands</li>
<li>Table top height counters of 30 inches will need low stools or dining chairs</li>
</ul><p>How many seats can you fit around an island? That depends on how tall the island is. Here’s a simple guideline on how much countertop space you need to allow for each seated person:</p>
<ul><li>30 inch high countertop: 30 inch wide by 19 inch deep space</li>
<li>36 inch high countertop: 24 inch wide by 15 inch deep space</li>
<li>42 inch high countertop: 24 inch wide by 12 inch deep space</li>
</ul><p>Before you decide to add seating to your kitchen island, take a look at my favorite design ideas. Let me know your favorite layouts after your read the article.</p>
<h2>Islands with Seating for 5</h2>

<p>Most kitchen islands only have enough space for two or three guests, but with a little careful planning you can get enough seating for 5.</p>
<p>One advantage of a large island with seating is that it can serve as a casual dining area. Why not entertain your guests while you cook? </p>
<p>Today a gourmet kitchen is more than a place for just cooking. It’s also a great place to entertain or serve dinner for the entire family.</p>
<p>Whether you need seating for 4, 5 or 6 people there are creative ways to add space around your island. A raised breakfast bar is the most common, but there are many other ways to make the most of your island. </p>

<h2>Islands with a Breakfast Bar</h2>
<div id="attachment_1739" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_breakfast_bar.jpg" alt="Breakfast Bar - Photo" width="500" height="408" class="size-full wp-image-1739" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_breakfast_bar.jpg 500w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_breakfast_bar-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Breakfast Bar – <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/242184/Vashon-Residence-kitchen-contemporary-kitchen-seattle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Photo</a></p></div>
<p>One of the most popular styles of kitchen islands with seating is one with a raised breakfast bar. Not only does the bar help create separate work spaces within a big kitchen, it also adds character to a traditional kitchen layout. </p>
<p>A breakfast bar is versatile because it offers a great place to sit and a comfortable ledge to lean or stand against. </p>
<p>If you have a high-traffic kitchen, a breakfast bar can serve as a great place to stop and chat momentarily or even serve up appetizers during a party.</p>
<h2>Modern Island with Breakfast Bar</h2>
<div id="attachment_1738" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/modern_kitchen_islands_with_seating.jpg" alt="Modern Island with Seating - Photo" width="500" height="334" class="size-full wp-image-1738" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/modern_kitchen_islands_with_seating.jpg 500w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/modern_kitchen_islands_with_seating-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Modern Island with Seating – <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/1191624/Munter-Residence-contemporary-kitchen-new-york" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Photo</a></p></div>
<p>Not only do kitchen islands with a breakfast bar work great in traditional homes, but they also work in modern spaces as well. </p>
<p>In this contemporary kitchen the breakfast bar adds depth to the open space. It also provides a front row seat to the cooking action.</p>
<p>Modern kitchens have the advantage of using more creative seating around the island. These bar stools add extra character to the space and can easily switched out for something entirely different if needed.</p>
<h2>Islands With Stools</h2>
<div id="attachment_1737" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_stools.jpg" alt="Island with Stools - Photo" width="500" height="332" class="size-full wp-image-1737" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_stools.jpg 500w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_stools-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Island with Stools – <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/676062/Kitchen-traditional-kitchen-philadelphia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Photo</a></p></div>
<p>Unlike kitchen islands with a breakfast bar, sometimes you just need a temporary place to sit in the kitchen. Kitchen islands with stools offer a casual sitting area with plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p>Stools can be small enough to be pushed under the counters to free up space when they’re not in use. I love islands with stools because they offer a simple way to transform your kitchen into a social space without wasting precious countertop real estate. </p>
<p>A few stools can let your guests join in on the cooking action without getting in the way. The question is, how many stools can you fit around your kitchen island?</p>
<p><strong>When shopping for stools remember to keep these guidelines in mind:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Standard bar stools fit underneath 42 to 46 inch high breakfast bars</li>
<li>Counter stools will work with 36 inch high islands</li>
</ul><h2>For Small Kitchens</h2>
<div id="attachment_1736" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_seating_for_small_kitchens.jpg" alt="Island with Seating in Small Kitchen - Photo" width="500" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-1736" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_seating_for_small_kitchens.jpg 500w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kitchen_islands_with_seating_for_small_kitchens-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Island with Seating in Small Kitchen – <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/2839481/Registe-eclectic-kitchen-new-york" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Photo</a></p></div>
<p>Kitchen islands with seating are normally found in large homes with lots of space. But what about small kitchens? Is it possible to add seating even in a small space?</p>
<p>In this example there is limited space for an island, but a creative use of the layout allow for seating against the kitchen wall. How can you incorporate seating into your small kitchen?</p>
<p>Another simple solution is by adding a few bar stools to sit next to an island or workspace. While you may not have room for leg space under your island in a small kitchen, adding a few temporary seats could help.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see I barely scratched the surface on kitchen island ideas with seating. </p>
<p>In fact, there were hundreds of photos I wanted to include but had to narrow it down to only five. I hope these examples will help inspire you to design your own kitchen.</p>

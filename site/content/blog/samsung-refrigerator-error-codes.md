When your refrigerator randomly starts flashing strange letters and numbers it can be a frustrating experience. 

You might be thinking _"What is my refrigerator trying to tell me and how do I make it stop?"_

The good news is that Samsung refrigerator error codes are designed to help you solve most problems without calling a technician. Unlike other kitchen appliances [that don't have error codes](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/garbage-disposal-humming-but-not-working/), Samsung makes it easy to figure out which part has failed.

**Below we've collected the 29 most common error codes you might encounter with a Samsung refrigerator to help you diagnose the problem.**



## Most Common Error Codes



The majority of refrigerator error codes are caused by either power outages or from the door being left open too long. Both of which are simple and easy to fix.

For example, if the digital display on the refrigerator is flashing the error code **"OF OF"** this means it is in _Cooling Off Mode_. 

Usually this code is given when the door has been open for an extended period of time and the internal temperature has risen. The refrigerator will work quickly to cool down the items stored inside to the desired temperature.

Another error code that is fairly common is **PC ER**. This means that the connection between the door and the main unit in the refrigerator has been interrupted or disconnected. Check the connection at the top of the refrigerator door for any debris and verify that the door is closed completely.

Other codes such as **88 88, 83E, 85E, or 86E** can be triggered when the power goes out or is interrupted. The easiest way to stop these error codes is to unplug the refrigerator for 60 seconds and plug it back in. This procedure will restart the refrigerator and should eliminate the errors.

If the error codes return you should consult the tables below for more information and have the refrigerator serviced.

## Samsung Blinking Line Error Codes



Unlike the numbered error codes listed above, blinking line error codes can be much more difficult to translate.

Each line on the digital display represents a different numbered code. You will need to use the graphic below to decide which error code has been triggered.

If your refrigerator starts giving you an error code, make sure you write it down or draw a diagram of the lines flashing on the front panel.

In the event you unplug your refrigerator, the internal computer will reset and the codes will be lost. The repairman will need to know as much information about the codes to properly diagnose and repair the problem. 

However, if you attempt to solve the problem yourself, you will need this same information to order the correct replacement parts.

As you can see, with over 30 possible Samsung refrigerator error codes available, it is easy to diagnose any potential problems. In fact, the most common codes are caused by power outage or interruption and can be solved by unplugging and re-plugging the appliance.

## White

_One of the best kitchen cabinet colors is also the simplest._

White kitchen cabinets are a popular design choice that will last for decades without going out of style or appearing outdated. Today white kitchen cabinets can be found in the most contemporary homes as well as in traditional country cottages. And they both look stunning.

**Not only are white kitchen cabinets timeless, but they also make small kitchens look larger and brighter.**

A neutral base also allows for more opportunity to highlight colors on the walls, experiment with new countertop materials and use accents or highlights.

Traditional kitchens can get the same benefits of white cabinets while softening their look by using an off-white or eggshell color. This will give your cabinets an antique look while maintaining a solid finish that’s guaranteed to last a long time.



## Green

Although white kitchen cabinets are the most popular choice when painting your cabinets, there’s no reason to shy away from color. Pale green color palettes will freshen up your kitchen and give you a touch of color. 

The careful use of green can help give your kitchen a timeless look without the risk of going out of style. However, now we’re entering dangerous territory where a slight color miscalculation could send you into the lime green abyss.

Green cabinets are a great addition to a traditional kitchen or craftsman style home with intricate wood detailing and butcher block countertops.



## Black or Mocha

A popular kitchen cabinet color in modern homes is black or mocha kitchen cabinets. Dark and bold colors will anchor the room and give a strong presence. Using contrasting colors and materials on the counters and walls will make an immediate impression on your guests.

The benefits of black kitchen cabinets is that they allow for creativity when choosing your accessories and accent colors. Future homeowners will have the ability to update or change the accent colors while still enjoying the timeless design of dark kitchen cabinets.

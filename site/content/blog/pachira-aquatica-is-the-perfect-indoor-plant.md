## Beautiful Braided Trunk



Money Trees can be purchased already braided. However, if you are adventurous you can do it yourself. You'll need to purchase a plant with at least 3 stalks, or wait until 3 stalks have sprouted. 

While the stalks are green and flexible, start braiding at the bottom of the plant and work your way to the top. When you reach the top, use string to loosely tie the ends together. As the tree continues to grow, continue braiding every 2-3 months.

Be careful not to braid the stalks too tight or they may snap. In the event your Money Tree breaks while braiding, have no fear. You can tape the broken pieces back together with grafting tape or even duct tape. In about a month, the tree will have healed itself and will be ready to be braided again.



## Associated with Good Financial Fortune



The Money Tree is an important element of feng shui design because it can improve your financial prosperity if placed in the correct area of your home.

According to traditional feng shui practices, the Southeast area of your home or office is most connected to your wealth and abundance. Adding a money tree to this part of your home or office, could mean good things for your financial future.

There are many stories floating around as to why Pachira Aquatica is called the Money Tree. One of the most common stories is that the five leaves on the tree perfectly represent the five fundamental Feng Shui elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth.



## You Practically Can't Overwater It



Pachira Aquatica grows in wetlands or swamps and loves damp soil. If you've had trouble growing indoor plants in the past, this tree may be just right for you.

It is common for indoor plants to die from overwatering. However, the Money Tree needs to be watered 2-3 times per week.

Your pot must have drainage holes on the bottom, and all water must be able to completely drain out. When watering your Money Tree, make sure all of the soil gets watered adequately.

In the winter when there is less natural light, the tree will not grow as quickly. This means it will not need as much water as usual. 

Keep an eye on the health of the leaves and soil dampness to decide if you should water more or less. If the leaves turn yellow and fall off, you may need to water more. However, if the leaves begin to fall off while they are still healthy and green, you should water less frequently.



## Thrives in Indirect Light



The Money Tree is great for the home or office because it only needs indirect light to thrive and it loves fluorescent light. This flexibility is great if you have limited space to grow your tree or want to keep it on a desk or side table away from a window.



## Safe for Cats and All Other Pets



The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ([ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/)) has deemed the Money Tree as non-toxic to cats and all other pets.

That being said, you should place your Money Tree in a spot where it will get less attention from your pets. While it is non-toxic to animals, cats may suffer upset stomachs if they eat too much of the plant. 

Your plant's health may also suffer if too much of it is eaten at once or if the stalks are damaged by a curious feline.



## Rarely Needs Pruning



Another great reason to give this as a gift is that it is very low maintenance. The tree requires almost no pruning, unless desired.

You can occasionally prune the leaves to keep your plant small and tidy. Be careful not to over prune all at once, as this may damage the plant.



## Big or Small



Pachira Aquatica grows up to 60 feet tall in the wild, but it is more common to find it planted as a bonsai. The height of the tree is closely related to the size of the pot it sits in. The larger the pot, the taller it will grow. 

If you purchase a Money Tree from a store, they are usually about one to two feet tall. It typically takes about 5 years for it to reach this size. Overtime the plant needs to be repotted to keep it in good health.



## Conclusion



We think a Money Tree is one of the best indoor plants for many reasons. Besides the fact that it may bring good financial fortune, we like that it is low maintenance. This is a great benefit if you are giving it as a gift to someone with little gardening experience.

Another reason we like Pachira Aquatica is that it thrives in low light. This gives you the flexibility to place it almost anywhere you want, including on your desk.

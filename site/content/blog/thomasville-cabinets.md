Thomasville Cabinets has a dream to transform your entire home with gorgeous new cabinets. The company offers cabinets for the kitchen, office, bathroom, and any other room of your house. Many customers choose this brand for its custom accents, numerous door styles and finishes. 

The cabinets are sold through 150+ independently owned Thomasville Home Furnishings Stores and Home Depot. You can see the cabinets in either of these locations where a professional can help you with your selection. 



## Company Background



Thomasville Cabinetry has been in business for over 100 years. They first started in North Carolina in 1904. Their first product was a chair and over the years they added many new products to their line. 

Today they offer cabinetry, home furnishings, flooring, lighting, and accessories. All of these products are manufactured throughout North America. 



## Construction Quality



Thomasville cabinets come in two construction options. The customer can choose between standard or an all-plywood construction. 

Both of these options feature a 3/4” thick solid hardwood face frame. The drawers are made of 3/4" all plywood sides and dovetail joinery. 

The drawer bottom of a standard drawer uses 1/4” maple laminate plywood. The drawers also feature a QuietClose premium full-extension guide. 

The back panel of the cabinets is a solid 3/8” and is designed to be load bearing to provide dependable support. Shelves are 3/4” thick and are secured with clips at the ends and middle for extra support and strength. 

**Wood Types offered by Thomasville Cabinetry includes:**




	
  * Alder

	
  * Cherry

	
  * Hickory

	
  * Maple

	
  * Oak

	
  * Rustic Alder

Finish options include light cabinets, medium, and dark. You can also choose to finish your cabinets with a glazed, distressed, or heirloom technique finish. 

Many enjoy Thomasville Cabinets due to the large variety of door profiles offered. Among the options are; raised panel arch, raised panel cathedral, square panel, and recessed panel.



## Common Complaints



When reading customer reviews, it quickly becomes apparent that there are only two responses to Thomasville Cabinets. Either the customers love them or hate them, there is no in between. 

Many customers have experienced poor quality materials, mismatched finishes, and missing/damaged parts. For many the construction was poor, and the cabinets quickly succumbed to damage.  

On _ReKitchen_, a consumer guide to kitchen renovation 20/29 reviewers were very unsatisfied while only 5 of the 29 were pleased with their purchase. Numbers can be deceptive, though, as it is usually only the dissatisfied that bother to leave a review. 

You may want to address these concerns with your local dealer and be aware of them in advance so that any delays or damaged parts do not put you in a bind with your remodel timeline. 



## Conclusion



At face value, Thomasville cabinets are beautiful and can enhance the appearance of any room in your home. Their wide array of wood materials, accessories, and panel styles allow you to find your favorite look. 

When it comes to the quality, customers responded on both ends of the spectrum. Some claim only the best while others completely regret their purchase. 

So if you're ready to remodel your kitchen take the time to research and speak to the representative at Home Depot. When installed properly with all the intended parts, Thomasville Cabinets can add value to your home.

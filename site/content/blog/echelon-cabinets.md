In 2012, Armstrong Cabinets was acquired by the American Industrial Partners. The brand was reinvented as Echelon Cabinetry and Advanta Cabinets.  

The reinvented company is popular for several reasons, including a large product line and their new Echelon Cabinetry Visualizer. This tool allows customers to experiment and design their kitchen virtually to make the best decision regarding their remodel.

By mixing, matching, and experimenting with this tool, homeowners can make informed choices about what they want. With their innovative space management solutions and progressive cabinetry, it is not surprising Echelon is a popular brand.

Currently, these cabinets can be purchased online or viewed at a showroom. Simply type in your zip code on their website to find one near you. 



## Company Background



The company headquarters are based in Texas while the primary production/manufacture facilities are in Thompsontown, Pennsylvania. 

The original Armstrong company sold its cabinet business because they wanted to focus solely on floorings and ceilings. Before this, Armstrong Cabinets was part of [Armstrong World Industries, Inc.](http://www.armstrong.com/) incorporated in 1891.  

Once acquired by [AIP](http://www.americanindustrial.com/), the former Armstrong Cabinets was reinvented and continues to provide gorgeous cabinets under the Echelon and Advent name. 



## Construction Quality



Echelon, formerly Armstrong, offers two tiers of quality construction. The first is the ALLWOOD Series. This is Echelon’s top tier with many of the same quality features found in custom built cabinets. 

This type of construction is available for all of their styles. It features hardwood plywood sides and bottom panels for a proactive stance against swelling caused by water exposure. 

The interior of the cabinets is protected by a clear coat sealer finish making it easy to clean. The four-sided drawer boxes are mounted with drawer tracks and Cushion Tec for a soft close and are made of solid wood. 

The drawers also allow you to choose between full-access dovetail or full-extension drawer styles. The hardware is high quality and features 6-way adjustable concealed hinges. 

The second construction tier is titled the PREMIER TM Series. This gives customers a budget-friendly choice that doesn’t sacrifice quality or style. This construction uses a composite panel construction with multi-ply hardwood hang rails. 

The exterior is covered with matching laminate. The drawers, dovetail/full extension options, and hinges still feature solid wood and the features seen in the ALLWOOD series. 

Decorative hardware, such as handles come in a wide selection of styles and finishes to match your chosen decor theme. 

**These styles include:**


  * Contemporary


  * Eclectic


  * Tradition


  * Transitional



**Echelon provides 32 different door styles in six different wood species. These wood species include:**


  * Birch


  * Cherry


  * Maple


  * Oak


  * Rustic Alder


  * Thermo foil



## Common Complaints


There are few complaints against Echelon Cabinets apart from their higher pricing. This can be attributed to either their high quality or the fact that the company was recently reinvented and launched in 2012.

**Editor's Note:** If you have experience with Echelon or Armstrong cabinets we would love to hear from you!



## Conclusion



[Echelon](http://www.echeloncabinetry.com/) and [Advanta Cabinets](http://www.advantacabinets.com/) offer quality and a great selection for those seeking to improve the value of their home. 

Unlike basic product lines, Echelon offers a large variety of styles, finishes, and accessories such as drawer organizers, stemware holders, and slide out containers. Everything is well-designed and created to last. 

Their two different construction types allow customers to choose one that best fits their budgets. When it comes down to the bottom line, the investment into Echelon, formerly Armstrong cabinets, appears to be well worth the cost.

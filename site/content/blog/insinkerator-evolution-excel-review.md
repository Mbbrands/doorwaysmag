## Specifications



The InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1.0 HP Household Garbage Disposer can sit under even the smallest sinks, thanks to its diminutive proportions. 

The glossy stainless steel finish imparts a classy, modern look that will be a perfect fit for modern kitchen decor. The 40 oz. grind chamber is large enough to accommodate all your garbage, even if you have a large family.



## Features



![insinkerator evolution excel intallation](https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/insinkerator_evolution_excel_intallation-300x300.jpg)

The continuous feed disposal unit features strong construction and uses premium quality material. Not only is it easy to install and get running, but the unit is built with high quality stainless steel which adds to the durability factor. 

The Dura-Drive motor runs a 1 HP and makes short work of your food scraps. For stubborn items and tough jams, the built-in jam sensor circuit can automatically bring up the torque to reduce clogging and facilitate easy grinding of your waste. 

The unit also features auto-reverse technology, which intelligently reverses the direction of blade rotation to achieve better grinding performance. 



## Additional Features and Warranty



One great benefit of the InSinkErator Evolution Excel is quiet, noise-free operation. 

While the anti-vibration sink mount takes care of vibration noise, the patented SoundSeal technology allows for superior noise insulation of the motor and grinding area, providing you with almost zero-noise operation. 

With this system, you would never have to worry about what you put in your garbage- the unit packs enough power to deal with all regular food and kitchen wastes. Just following a simple list of do’s and don’ts is enough to ensure years of hassle-free, high-performance operation. The generous 7-year in-home warranty is a testimony of the confidence and faith the manufacturers have placed on this product.

<p>After a hard day’s work, there’s nothing I enjoy better than putting my feet up. Well, maybe it could be even better with a cold drink in hand, too.</p>
<p>But, recently I’ve upped my relaxing game. How did I do it? With a hanging bed on my porch, that’s how.</p>
<p>If you’ve never had the pleasure of lying in one of these, let me introduce you to 15 of my favorite hanging beds. </p>
<p>These are great outside on the porch or even inside your bedroom. The only thing stopping you is your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Before you decide to build one of these in your home, be sure to consult a contractor in your area. Hanging any amount of weight from the ceiling can be dangerous if you don’t know what you are doing. So, people – please be careful!</p>
<h2>Hanging from Ceiling</h2>
<div id="attachment_66" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/traditional_girls_bedroom_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via Tamara Rosenbloom Design" width="800" height="779" class="size-full wp-image-66" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/traditional_girls_bedroom_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/traditional_girls_bedroom_hanging_bed-510x497.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/traditional_girls_bedroom_hanging_bed-300x292.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/5698317/Kopachuck-Residence-transitional-kids-seattle" target="_blank">Tamara Rosenbloom Design</a></p></div>
<p>This is a great example of how to hang a bed in a children’s room. But don’t be fooled, these are for kids of all ages – including adults. The floating bed adds a sense of whimsy to the room as well as a unique flare.</p>
<div id="attachment_68" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_bunk_beds.jpg" alt="Photo via Visbeen Architects" width="800" height="520" class="size-full wp-image-68" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_bunk_beds.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_bunk_beds-510x332.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_bunk_beds-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/459460/Bedroom-contemporary-kids-grand-rapids" target="_blank">Visbeen Architects</a></p></div>
<p>If one is good, two is better. Instead of installing clunking bunk beds, why not hang two beds from the ceiling at once. It is a fun alternative to traditional children’s bedroom furniture. Just make sure you install them securely as you’ll need to support twice the normal weight.</p>
<div id="attachment_69" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_twin_beds.jpg" alt="Photo via Our Town Plans" width="600" height="846" class="size-full wp-image-69" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_twin_beds.jpg 600w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_twin_beds-510x719.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_twin_beds-213x300.jpg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/6330294/Captains-Watch-beach-style-bedroom" target="_blank">Our Town Plans</a></p></div>
<p>While many hanging bed kits use chain because it’s inexpensive, this bedroom has the beds suspended from the ceiling with thick rope. It is not only strong and practical but it also brings together the nautical theme in this coastal guest bedroom.</p>
<div id="attachment_70" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/girls_bedroom_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via Anne Becker Design" width="600" height="686" class="size-full wp-image-70" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/girls_bedroom_hanging_bed.jpg 600w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/girls_bedroom_hanging_bed-510x583.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/girls_bedroom_hanging_bed-262x300.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/20439107/Daughters-Bedroom-beach-style-kids-boston" target="_blank">Anne Becker Design</a></p></div>
<p>Here is another example of a bed hung from the ceiling with rope. This version is decorated in a contemporary style with touches of yellow and purple to offset the white walls and bedding. </p>
<div id="attachment_71" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/metal_frame_hanging_bunk_beds.jpg" alt="Photo via Market of Fleas" width="600" height="901" class="size-full wp-image-71" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/metal_frame_hanging_bunk_beds.jpg 600w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/metal_frame_hanging_bunk_beds-510x766.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/metal_frame_hanging_bunk_beds-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/1455814/Lake-Minnetonka-Cottage-rustic-bedroom-minneapolis" target="_blank">Market of Fleas</a></p></div>
<p>This is another great example of hanging bunk beds from the ceiling. Also notice how the designer chose to remove the outer cover of the box spring to make the beds look like they are actually floating. You could incorporate this idea into almost any hanging bed as long as you used a metal frame instead of wood.</p>
<div id="attachment_72" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/enclosed_patio_hanging_daybed.jpg" alt="Photo via Shiflet Group" width="800" height="602" class="size-full wp-image-72" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/enclosed_patio_hanging_daybed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/enclosed_patio_hanging_daybed-510x384.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/enclosed_patio_hanging_daybed-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/877410/Rustic-Patio-rustic-patio-austin" target="_blank">Shiflet Group</a></p></div>
<p>This Austin, Texas home features a hanging day bed in an enclosed patio. No extra modifications were needed to hang this bed as the joists were large enough to accomodate the extra weight.</p>
<div id="attachment_73" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pool_house_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via BellaWood Builders" width="800" height="485" class="size-full wp-image-73" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pool_house_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pool_house_hanging_bed-510x309.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pool_house_hanging_bed-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/6234403/Corcoran-Poolhouse-transitional-patio-minneapolis" target="_blank">BellaWood Builders</a></p></div>
<p>Can you imagine yourself relaxing in the pool house day bed? Me, too. The bed is hung from a large patio trellis with ropes and covered in large throw pillows.</p>
<div id="attachment_75" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/roof_deck_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via Chicago Roof Deck and Garden" width="800" height="482" class="size-full wp-image-75" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/roof_deck_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/roof_deck_hanging_bed-510x307.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/roof_deck_hanging_bed-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/3111445/Elevated-Style-in-Lakeview-contemporary-deck-chicago" target="_blank">Chicago Roof Deck and Garden</a></p></div>
<p>This Chicago deck features a wood day bed hung with chain. Notice how the extra chain is collected at the top instead of at the bottom. The bed frame features a dark stain and a back railing on one side.</p>
<div id="attachment_76" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/wrought_iron_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via Cheney Brothers Building and Renovation" width="800" height="530" class="size-full wp-image-76" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/wrought_iron_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/wrought_iron_hanging_bed-510x338.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/wrought_iron_hanging_bed-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/5997131/Modern-Nantucket-Renovation-beach-style-bedroom-boston" target="_blank">Cheney Brothers Building and Renovation</a></p></div>
<p>Hanging beds can be suspended using a wide variety of materials. The only limit is your imagination – oh yeah, and it must be strong enough, too. So far we have seen beds hung with chain and rope but this bed is hung using wrought iron rods linked together. These rods were custom made by a local iron worker, but I imagine that you could have something similar created if your heart so desired.</p>
<div id="attachment_77" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hammock_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via The Cousins" width="800" height="528" class="size-full wp-image-77" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hammock_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hammock_hanging_bed-510x337.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hammock_hanging_bed-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/2677014/Ruppert-Backyard-eclectic-patio-new-york" target="_blank">The Cousins</a></p></div>
<p>I wanted to include this hanging bed in the gallery because it is a great example of the flexibility you have with hanging beds. Not every bed needs to be square and flat. This bed is almost a cross between a hammock and a daybed – boy does it look comfortable!</p>
<div id="attachment_78" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hanging_daybed.jpg" alt="Photo via Laura U" width="800" height="538" class="size-full wp-image-78" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hanging_daybed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hanging_daybed-510x343.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/patio_hanging_daybed-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/1299486/Bellaire-Guest-House-contemporary-porch-houston" target="_blank">Laura U</a></p></div>
<p>Although I showcased many interior hanging beds, some of my favorites are those designed for outside use. Here is another great example. While small, this hanging daybed is built with a wood frame and hung with thick rope. It is a comfortable alternative to standard patio furniture.</p>
<div id="attachment_79" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pod_hanging_bed.jpg" alt="Photo via Fabio Galeazzo Brazil" width="800" height="677" class="size-full wp-image-79" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pod_hanging_bed.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pod_hanging_bed-510x432.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/pod_hanging_bed-300x254.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/795676/Fabio-Galeazzo-Brazil-contemporary-living-room" target="_blank">Fabio Galeazzo Brazil</a></p></div>
<p>Of course, I can’t finish this gallery without showing a photo of a hanging pod bed. This bed is hung from one single point in the ceiling. Keep in mind that this would require extra structural support compared to the other beds I’ve shown which have attachments at all four corners.</p>

<h2>Hanging from Wall</h2>
<p>Not everything needs to hang from the ceiling. In fact, these rooms attach the beds to the walls. If you have limited space this is a clever way to hang multiple beds within one room.</p>
<div id="attachment_74" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_beds_against_wall.jpg" alt="Photo via M/I Homes" width="800" height="546" class="size-full wp-image-74" srcset="https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_beds_against_wall.jpg 800w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_beds_against_wall-510x348.jpg 510w, https://www.doorwaysmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hanging_beds_against_wall-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo via <a href="http://www.houzz.com/photos/12492490/M-I-Homes-Of-Cincinnati-Carriage-Hill-The-Creeks-Avalon-Model-contemporary-kids-cincinnati" target="_blank">M/I Homes</a></p></div>
<p>This kids room features two beds hung from the walls. The design of the frame prevents the bed from swaying while getting in or out. If you are concerned about your children swinging in their bed wildly, the wall hung beds are a good alternative.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, after writing about all of these hanging beds I’m ready to call it a day. If you have any questions, I’ll be lying down out on my porch.</p>
<p>All kidding aside, I hope you have found inspiration for your next home improvement project. As you can see there are a wide variety of bed styles and hanging mechanisms available. </p>
<p>The most important part to remember is to consult a professional before installing anything from your ceiling. Although I’m a big fan of DIY projects, when making structural changes to your home things can get out of hand quickly – a.k.a. expensive.</p>
<p>So, make sure you plan out your project ahead of time, ask for advice from pros and use the right tools. Before you know it you’ll be relaxing out on your porch or even in your bedroom.</p>
